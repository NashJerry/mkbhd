       " 'transcript': \"hey what is up guys I'm Kay PhD here and the Samsung Galaxy s4 will easily be one of the most popular phones of 2013 no doubt and when Samsung builds up that much hype for any phone like they do with the s4 especially when the predecessor the s3 is so popular we kind of expect the s4 to be a really good phone and a lot of people see the Galaxy s4 as an evolutionary update to the galaxy s3 and understandably so because of the naming but after my time with it I'm seeing it a bit differently I'm seeing the galaxy s4 as more of a downsized reconstructed note to hear me out so the galaxy s4 is more square than the galaxy s3 first of all and although it has very similar dimensions Samsung will tell you that it's slightly thinner and slightly lighter so that's true but you won't really notice these differences if you're familiar with the galaxy s3 you also feel right at home with the button layout and the port layout because they're the same on the galaxy s4 and they're also the same as they are on the galaxy note 2 but overall the phone just looks and feels just different different in the way the Galaxy Note 2 feels different from the s3 mostly because this design again it's more square and then you check out the insides you already know that you can take off the back the thin flexible plastic back of the galaxy s4 to reveal the internals and that will reveal a removable 2600 milliamp hour battery and a micro SD card slot and the speaker micro SIM card etc now compare this to the galaxy s3 on the left and the galaxy note 2 on the right and there is even more reason to consider the s4 a restructured note to the speaker is now down in the bottom at the same place the battery is also now lower in the chassis and the microSD card and micro SIM card slots are now above the battery instead of below all these like the note 2 not the s3 also on the galaxy s3 the edges were so tapered that you had no real edge of the phone to grip and that was a bit of a problem for me but with the new s4 design you actually have that metallic band around the phone that creates an edge to grip before the tapering starts it's a small touch and it's something a lot of reviewers look past as a cheap attempt to look more premium but it actually really changes the feel of the galaxy s4 in the hand you hold it so on the hardware side of things consider this guy a compacted Galaxy Note 2 that's just the way it feels in the hand and the way it's built on the software side of things though this is familiar Samsung territory so here on the galaxy s4 we have an updated TouchWiz on top of Android 4.2 jelly bean this time so first of all since it's Android 4.2 now you get a bunch of new google features like for example the quick settings in the notification bar that Samsung so generously colorized and added to they're accessible with a two finger swipe down from the top of the notification bar and you can basically customize them to let you one tap toggle any feature on the phone which is actually kind of nice it's convenient and you also get Android 4.2 S lock screen widgets and the first one I install it as dashclock of course because it's beautiful but yeah plenty of apps are supported you can swipe to the right to open the camera or swipe to add more lock screen widgets there a welcome addition that the Galaxy s3 and note 2 don't have yet and then there's the rest of TouchWiz so Samsung stuffed this phone to the gills with software features inside of TouchWiz a lot of them will make for great commercials and gimmicky tricks and neat demos so this one is very demo able which is very good for Samsung but in the end a lot of these features probably won't be used by the average user so for example air view is new it lets you hover your finger over an album in the gallery to get a preview of the photos inside it's useful it works but it's an extra gesture you have to learn and people are used to just tapping in an opening gallery anyway so I don't know if people will use that there's also things like smart scroll and smart stay and smart pause and all this smart stuff that's supposed to basically read your eyes using a front-facing camera and take action or adjust itself accordingly they all work most of the time but if you have them on by accident or you don't want them to be on you may find your phone scrolling up and down or pausing videos or changing orientation by itself when you didn't want or need it to do that so I ended up turning these features off after a while they got annoying and I just didn't need them and I did an explanation video of all these things so I'll leave a link right below the like button on this video if you want an explanation of all the galaxy s4 software features but basically overall TouchWiz has a lot of new added features that are like I said great for demos it's great for showing off to your friends or something like that but eventually I turn them off because they just weren't doing it for me I don't really need them overall though TouchWiz is still very colorful as we've seen on other devices and very very contrast II just like on the galaxy s3 and the note 2 and touch which is very contrasting because it's also on that M OLED display and speaking of that display this is no ordinary AMOLED display the galaxy s4 is rocking a 1920 by 1080 Super AMOLED plus display so that gives it a pixel density of 441 pixels per inch and it does have a pentile sub pixel matrix but nobody can tell this display has far more pixels in that 5 inch space than any naked eye can decipher and that means razor sharp text images video everything I love it it's what we've been waiting for it which what we knew was coming in the upgrade to the s4 and it is the number one reason to upgrade to this phone from something like the galaxy s3 now because it's an AMOLED display it also has a few advantages over other 1080p phones for example in deeper blacks higher contrast and lower power consumption but all of that comes with the trade-off that this display is no brighter than the galaxy s3 so it kind of struggles in daylight when compared to something like the HTC One but that's of course another video now it's pushing these pixels with the Snapdragon 600 processor in the United States which if you don't know is an absolute tank of a processor just a performance monster benchmark killer and all-around great chip so it's going to score really high on pretty much any benchmark that you put it through and it's also going to get you great power consumption as well so I was able to get all-day battery life again about the same battery life as the galaxy s3 with the stock battery I was using the galaxy s3 on Verizon which was an LTE network and I was using the galaxy s4 on AT&T which is now te network and I was getting about the same battery life so despite the more powerful processor and the bigger sharper display you're going to get about the same battery which is pretty good for me all day now you can't talk about that galaxy s4 without a little bit about that camera and I gotta say it is an awesome one I'd say the best camera on any smartphone I've ever used to date and that's including the latest iPhone 5 the Galaxy Note 2 the galaxy s3 the HTC One the Lumia 920 this tops them all for me this is just an awesome all-around solid performing 13 megapixel camera for pretty much all types of situations the camera app of course is updated to the new version of TouchWiz so it looks a lot like the interface on the samsung galaxy camera now and again it's filled with all these tons of gimmicky TouchWiz features that most people will never even know they have in their pocket but a few of them were actually kind of cool so people like to get creative with their cameras you know so for example I fell in love with the animated photo feature that lets you take a few seconds of video clip and then basically animate just a part of it to form a jiff and there are so many unique ways to use is it's not even funny I was walking around New York City all the time just taking these and the only real problem is sharing them because pretty much only Google+ supports gifs that big but it was very cool to use that feature and I also take HDR's a lot so it was good to see HDR make another appearance in this new version no photo spheres unfortunately kind of sucks since we're on android 4.2 and everything but yeah I guess they can get away with omitting that I'll include a full resolution panorama I took in New York in the description below so you can see the real quality because YouTube won't really let me show you just how good-looking the photos this thing takes are but trust me when I say they are beautifully sharp and detailed with all those pixels and definitely good with the color department too it's a solid performer in low-light as well it's no Lumia 920 it's no HTC One and low-light but it definitely produces acceptable photos and pretty much any lighting situation which lets me give it the crown of the best all-around camera in a smartphone so at the end of the day there are a lot of things to like about the sonne from the 1080p display to the battery life to the note 2 like squarish design to the things like you know the little TouchWiz improvements on top of Android 4.2 yet then again there are plenty of things not to like for example the Settings app which took a huge step down and currently sucks with this lame tabbed interface that you can't even swipe through to get but it's really all about your values on when it comes to judging things like that and the huge question at the end of the day is is it worth your upgrade is it worth your money to upgrade from the Galaxy s3 or from other phones and right now the verdict is if you have to have 1080p AMOLED then yes this is the way to go this is the only way to go if not then you might be better off waiting the software features you see here are basically around the corner and a firmware update from the galaxy s3 and the Galaxy Note 2 and other Samsung phones but what about other phones like the HTC One or other 1080p devices well there are some benefits to the galaxy s4 for example it's made of plastic which is a pro because that gives you a generally better signal strength you get a lighter phone a little bit thinner and you also get very fast GPS lock with a plastic back but then again there are cons like it being a fingerprint magnet and feeling cheap in the hand so overall that decision comes down to what you prefer in a phone overall though I think this is a great phone I'm definitely enjoying every second I spend with it and maybe you will too this is definitely worth checking out I think I would go with the black version over the white version though just for the clean look and less fingerprints either way thank you for watching definitely subscribe and stay tuned for upcoming videos that relate to this one very very very very soon and you're definitely going to want to see those so I'll talk to you guys in the next video ace you \"}"

      "That's hugely important.\n",

      "10X periscope cameras.\n",
      "This new primary sensor setup though,\n",

      "and style of the photos,\n",
      "it absolutely still\n",

      "So when you go from a normal sensor\n",
      "to a super-high resolution\n",
      "200-megapixel sensor,\n",
      "the fact is, in these\n",
      "tiny smartphone cameras,\n",
      "the individual pixels are\n",
      "so small that individually,\n",
      "they physically can't\n",
      "bring in that much light.\n",
      "So the camera does this\n",
      "thing called binning,\n",
      "where it combines the information\n",
      "from a bunch of adjacent pixels\n",
      "to form larger more accurate\n",
      "pixels in your image.\n",
      "So you're not shooting\n",
      "200 megapixels by default,\n",
      "it's actually binning 16 pixels into one,\n",
      "so you end up taking a 12.5 megapixel shot\n",
      "for normal photos, but each photo\n",
      "is theoretically more\n",
      "accurate thanks to its makeup.\n",
      "And then like I said, the\n",
      "stabilization performance\n",
      "on this new primary camera has doubled.\n",
      "(phone rattles)\n",
      "Still rattles a little bit,\n",
      "but that means it'll correct\n",
      "up to three degrees of shake\n",
      "now versus the 1.5 from before,\n",
      "so here's an example of what's happening.\n",
      "If you get a lens\n",
      "with really good optical\n",
      "image stabilization,\n",
      "(lens rattles) like this one,\n",
      "that means it can\n",
      "correct from the movement\n",
      "in your hand much more,\n",
      "which means you can hold the\n",
      "camera stable for much longer,\n",
      "so it can leave the shutter open\n",
      "to collect more light and\n",

      "So if that's all you're looking at,\n",
      "just normal side by sides,\n",

      "I think the better compromise\n",

      "48-megapixel ProRAW shots\n",
      "in a variety of light, but now\n",
      "the files are five megabytes,\n",

      "and not as much noise.\n",
      "It's all about flexibility.\n",
      "The standard mode is gonna be the best\n",

      "Oh yeah, and also,\n",
      "don't forget about the better selfies too.\n",
      "There's a new 12 megapixel selfie camera\n",
      "in all these S23 phones.\n",
      "And while that number is lower on paper\n",

      "doesn't flare too much, and\n",
      "also has a decently wide angle.\n",
      "It's not ultra-wide but not bad.\n",
      "So across the board, this is significant,\n",
      "an extensive improvement to the camera,\n",
      "especially the primary camera.\n",
      "That feels overlooked to me\n",
      "when people have been reviewing the phone.\n",
      "The one thing I still will complain about\n",

      "So the time gap between\n",
      "hitting the shutter button\n",

      "even if you capture a crisp\n",
      "photo of the wrong moment.\n",
      "So, like I said, it's more pronounced\n",
      "when you take the ultra\n",
      "high resolution 50-megapixel\n",
      "or 200-megapixel photos.\n",
      "You can't exactly do those in rapid fire.\n",

      "fine missing out on it.\n",
      "So with the target\n",
      "demographic of this phone,\n",
      "it's totally fine.\n",

      "the richest technology\n",

      "the differences here?\n",
      "Or what about when they\n",
      "just added 5G to the iPhone\n",
      "and most people didn't care?\n",
      "Like, making subtle improvements over time\n",
      "is what modern smartphones\n",
      "are all about these days.\n",
      "And I would actually argue that\n",
      "a higher refresh rate is more noticeable\n",

      "Like, I think you could today\n",
      "hand me, a professional,\n",
      "an unlabeled iPhone with an\n",
      "A15 Bionic and an A16 Bionic,\n",
      "and it would take me quite some time\n",
      "to find the real differences between them.\n",
      "And so, that combined with the fact\n",
      "that it's incredibly cheap\n",
      "and easy and reasonable\n",
      "to get to like at least a 90 hertz phone,\n",
      "isn't the new Moto G is\n",
      "like 90 hertz at $170\n",
      "or something like that?\n",
      "Now I'm sure that's a\n",
      "horrible looking screen\n",
      "compared to this iPhone,\n",
      "it's 720P with the brightness\n",
      "of a box of crayons.\n",
      "But still they decided\n",
      "to add that to that phone\n",
      "because Motorola knew that\n",
      "enough people would notice it\n",
      "and feel that smoothness difference\n",
      "and it's a higher level\n",
      "of perceived performance.\n",
      "So it's just wild to me,\n",
      "knowing how easy it would\n",
      "be for Apple to make this\n",
      "even a 90 hertz display, but\n",
      "they just refuse to do it\n",
      "because they've attached the\n",
      "word Pro to that feature.\n",
      "It's promotion for the Pro phones.\n",
      "And it just strikes me as a tool\n",
      "just to sort of continue widening the gap\n",
      "as much as they can\n",
      "between the Pro iPhones\n",
      "and the non-Pro iPhones,\n",
      "and they're happy to do it,\n",
      "even if it makes this iPhone 15\n",
      "the most expensive phone in the world\n",
      "with a 60 hertz display.\n",
      "Anyway, speaking of widening that gap,\n",
      "the Pro phones this year also\n",
      "got a brand new A17 Pro chip\n",
      "but this iPhone 15 gets\n",
      "last year's A16 Bionic\n",
      "from the 14 Pro.\n",
      "Honestly, the renaming of the Pro chip\n",
      "might be the most interesting part\n",
      "because it implies that\n",
      "it's definitely not going to trickle down\n",
      "to the baseline phone next year.\n",
      "But either way, this A16 bionic here\n",
      "is more than good enough\n",
      "in a phone of this price,\n",
      "as far as performance and\n",
      "handling everyday tasks\n",
      "and gaming and flying\n",
      "around iOS at 60 hertz.\n",
      "And the one thing you definitely\n",
      "can argue for 60 hertz\n",
      "would be battery life,\n",
      "because despite all the\n",
      "issues floating around,\n",
      "the battery life on these\n",
      "phones has been pretty good.\n",
      "So I don't know if you saw it,\n",
      "but Apple has officially now addressed\n",
      "the heat and battery\n",
      "issues that some people,\n",
      "including myself, have been\n",
      "reporting with these iPhones.\n",
      "So an iOS update is coming\n",
      "and it seems like some\n",
      "specific third party apps,\n",
      "like Instagram, were also having issues\n",
      "and those should be getting updates too.\n",
      "But on average, the battery life on my 15\n",
      "has been better than my\n",
      "battery on the 15 Pro.\n",
      "And the 15 Plus looks to have\n",
      "the best battery life ever on any iPhone,\n",
      "which is really promising.\n",
      "So that combination of the\n",
      "A16 Bionic, which is not new,\n",
      "and 60 hertz screens, which are not new,\n",
      "are giving you great battery life.\n",
      "Also, USB-C is definitely not new\n",
      "but here it is alongside all\n",
      "the benefits that come with it,\n",
      "from using the same cable\n",
      "to charge everything,\n",
      "to plugging into more accessories,\n",
      "like monitors and keyboards\n",
      "and all kinds of other stuff.\n",
      "It is sad that the older chip does mean\n",
      "there's no USB 3 controller\n",
      "so there are no USB 3 data\n",
      "speeds, it's still slow,\n",
      "but honestly, unless you're using\n",
      "the Pro iPhone's camera features,\n",
      "there's almost nobody\n",
      "here buying this phone\n",
      "that's gonna actually need\n",
      "fast data transfer anyway\n",
      "so I guess you can give it a pass.\n",
      "And they managed to do\n",
      "it in the Apple way too.\n",
      "They color matched the\n",
      "inside of the USB-C port\n",
      "with the color of the\n",
      "phone, and they actually,\n",
      "I don't know if you've seen this,\n",
      "they print the model\n",
      "number inside the port.\n",
      "So Apple really loves hiding this\n",
      "in the most discreet way possible.\n",
      "You know, I should really\n",
      "gives some appreciation\n",
      "to some of the clever software\n",
      "features on the iPhone 15\n",
      "because you could actually\n",
      "consider them new.\n",
      "So they added stuff like\n",
      "an ultra-wideband chip\n",
      "so you can find your phone\n",
      "more easily with an Apple Watch\n",
      "or be found on Find My\n",
      "Friends, that's new.\n",
      "They also added these clever audio effects\n",
      "and video effects at an OS level,\n",
      "so they work inside of any app.\n",
      "So you can be on a phone\n",
      "call or a video call\n",
      "or a Google Meet or Zoom or whatever,\n",
      "and flip on the background\n",
      "noise cancellation\n",
      "and it works really shockingly well,\n",
      "it's very, very good.\n",
      "So I'm on a phone call with myself,\n",
      "this is what it'll sound\n",
      "like to be in a room\n",
      "with the dishwasher\n",
      "running, the HVAC going,\n",
      "and the sink going right next to me,\n",
      "right next to the microphone.\n",
      "When I switch the mic from Standard mode\n",
      "to Voice Isolation mode,\n",
      "even though all the same\n",
      "noises are still happening,\n",
      "it does a much better\n",
      "job of just picking out\n",
      "specifically my voice,\n",
      "really smart and it's genuinely new.\n",
      "There's also some other not so new stuff,\n",
      "like they just now added\n",
      "downloadable offline areas\n",
      "to Apple Maps and interactable widgets,\n",
      "and they finally added an\n",
      "80% battery charge limiter\n",
      "in the settings.\n",
      "So you can check out all this stuff,\n",
      "I did a full video on the iOS 17 update\n",
      "at the link below that like button,\n",
      "if you wanna watch that, you\n",
      "should definitely check it out\n",
      "after you watch this video.\n",
      "What I will say is one of\n",
      "the most liked features\n",
      "I talked about in that\n",
      "video is Standby mode.\n",
      "And on the Pro iPhone, when\n",
      "you put it on a charger,\n",
      "turn it sideways, it keeps the screen on\n",
      "which it can do because\n",
      "it goes to one Hertz,\n",
      "it's an LTPO display, and it's\n",
      "fine staying on like that.\n",
      "But on the non-Pro iPhone,\n",
      "which does not have LTPO,\n",
      "it's basically locked at I\n",
      "think either 30 or 60 hertz,\n",
      "either way it doesn't drop to one Hertz.\n",
      "So Apple just decides,\n",
      "we'll turn off the screen\n",
      "after a little bit,\n",
      "which kind of feels like it\n",
      "defeats the purpose of this feature,\n",
      "so then you have to nudge the\n",
      "table or or bump the stand\n",
      "to wake it up like an Apple Watch charger.\n",
      "Just a notable difference\n",
      "between the Pro and non-Pro iPhones.\n",
      "But last but not least,\n",
      "these new cameras are actually\n",
      "weird, but in a good way.\n",
      "So iPhone 15 has been upgraded\n",
      "to a new set of 12 megapixel ultra wide\n",
      "and the new 48 megapixel main camera.\n",
      "It's not the same sensor as the Pro,\n",
      "it's actually slightly smaller,\n",
      "but it has a larger max aperture\n",
      "of F1.6 to make up for it.\n",
      "And then, it's also\n",
      "doing a combo of binning\n",
      "and detailed transfer to give you\n",
      "this new 24 megapixel photo\n",
      "as a result by default.\n",
      "Now, if you were paying attention before,\n",
      "you'll remember that this new iPhone\n",
      "has the exact same chip\n",
      "as last year's Pro iPhone.\n",
      "Same processing cores, same\n",
      "image signal processor,\n",
      "same neural engine, same\n",
      "A16 Bionic, same everything.\n",
      "So why is this new 24 megapixel default\n",
      "only coming to the newest iPhone\n",
      "15 and not last year's Pro?\n",
      "Like, I still have last year's Pro phone\n",
      "and I've updated it to the latest software\n",
      "and it does not get this feature,\n",
      "it's still shooting 12 megapixels.\n",
      "So honestly now my base iPhone\n",
      "15's non-zoomed in photos\n",
      "are actually looking a little better,\n",
      "a little more detailed than\n",
      "last year's Pro phones.\n",
      "And then, there's the new\n",
      "auto-Portrait Mode detection\n",
      "feature, which is pretty sweet.\n",
      "Basically you don't have\n",
      "to switch to Portrait Mode\n",
      "to take a photo that captures\n",
      "all of the depth information\n",
      "that allows you to turn it into\n",
      "a Portrait Mode photo later.\n",
      "So as long as you're pointing\n",
      "the camera at a human subject\n",
      "or a cat or a dog as identified\n",
      "by the neural engine,\n",
      "or if you tap to focus, you\n",
      "automatically get this little F\n",
      "at the bottom corner of the screen,\n",
      "which means it's capturing the data needed\n",
      "for Portrait Mode, just in case.\n",
      "And so, then, later, if you decide,\n",
      "eh, I actually do want this\n",
      "to be a Portrait Mode shot,\n",
      "you go into your gallery\n",
      "and just make it a Portrait Mode photo,\n",
      "that you can even then go\n",
      "in and edit and play with.\n",
      "Some people have been describing it\n",
      "as being able to change\n",
      "the focus point later.\n",
      "It's not exactly doing that,\n",
      "you can't like save something\n",
      "that was out of focus by bringing it back.\n",
      "But basically, for the classic iPhone shot\n",
      "where it kind of looks like\n",
      "everything is in focus,\n",
      "then, yeah, you can\n",
      "play with Portrait Mode\n",
      "and get really good results.\n",
      "Last year's Pro iPhone has the same chip,\n",
      "also has a 48 megapixel main camera\n",
      "and has the same neural engine,\n",
      "doesn't get this feature, for some reason.\n",
      "Also kind of weird.\n",
      "So look, with these reviews,\n",
      "we always make a lot of judgements\n",
      "about what we think the\n",
      "typical iPhone buyer is,\n",
      "what they actually care\n",
      "about, what they'll notice,\n",
      "what they will appreciate\n",
      "about a new phone.\n",
      "And with this one, I do\n",
      "feel like they've stacked up\n",
      "enough of these subtle improvements,\n",
      "that even though it looks the same\n",
      "and there's not really that\n",
      "much that's actually new here,\n",
      "they've at least stacked enough things\n",
      "that it feels like an\n",
      "appreciably better phone.\n",
      "So my verdict is, if\n",
      "you have an iPhone 14,\n",
      "you don't have to upgrade,\n",
      "of course, even a 13 maybe.\n",
      "But if you have an older phone\n",
      "and you're looking to\n",
      "upgrade to a new iPhone,\n",
      "every year, I always\n",
      "get friends asking like,\n",
      "\"Oh, should I just get the older,\n",
      "like last year's iPhone\n",
      "to save some money?\"\n",
      "And no, I actually wouldn't,\n",
      "I would say just get the iPhone 15.\n",
      "There's enough new changes here,\n",
      "it's a better phone in\n",
      "every way and it's also USB.\n",
      "Like, you don't buy a base iPhone\n",
      "to get the bleeding edge of tech,\n",
      "you buy it just 'cause\n",
      "it works and it's fine\n",

      "work for the next few years.\n",
      "And just knowing that you're gonna have it\n",

      "I would not recommend\n",
      "buying a Lightning iPhone\n",
      "as we just moved everything forward\n",
      "into the world of USB type C.\n",
      "Just get the new one, just\n",
      "grab the boring new iPhone\n",
      "with nothing that's actually that new.\n",

      "one's a little bit better\n",
      "in a few ways.\n",
      "First of all, the camera circles\n",
      "did the iPhone Dynamic Island thing\n",
      "of combining themselves\n",
      "into one big circle\n",
      "which I actually like with\n",
      "these new bigger sensors here.\n",
      "And then also the Pro Pixels now have\n",
      "a completely flat display,\n",
      "so finally moving away from\n",
      "the slightly curved edges\n",
      "from the past years and a\n",
      "satin back in every color\n",
      "which does a shockingly good\n",
      "job at hiding fingerprints,\n",
      "if your team know case like I am.\n",
      "Aside from that though,\n",
      "everything else is right\n",
      "where you'd expect it.\n",
      "The one thing I wanna see\n",
      "if maybe they can fix now\n",
      "is the dust that always accumulates\n",
      "like right under and above the camera bar.\n",
      "Probably the only way to get rid of that\n",
      "is to sort of curve it like they did\n",
      "on the Oppo Find X4 and X3,\n",
      "but I don't know if they'll ever do that.\n",
      "But the biggest improvement\n",
      "to the hardware though\n",
      "is definitely upfront,\n",
      "honestly to the point where\n",
      "I feel like these new screens\n",
      "sort of tie the phone together\n",
      "in a way that they're up\n",
      "at the level of any other flagship phone.\n",
      "So the smaller Pixel 8 now has\n",
      "a 6.2-inch 1080P OLED display,\n",
      "slightly smaller than last year.\n",
      "And that display is surrounded now\n",
      "by perfectly thin even\n",
      "bezels all the way around,\n",
      "no more tiny chin like previous years.\n",
      "And it's now bumped up\n",

      "One, it's still just a single\n",
      "front-facing camera at the top\n",
      "but Google has found a way with software\n",

      "in order to be able to\n",
      "use it for secure unlock\n",
      "for things like banking apps\n",
      "and logging into things.\n",
      "So basically instead of\n",
      "adding more hardware up front\n",
      "like an infrared camera or\n",
      "a dot projector or radar,\n",
      "if you remember that,\n",
      "they just fix it in post\n",
      "with software magic and it's convenient.\n",
      "But then number two,\n",
      "the fingerprint reader has not improved.\n",
      "So remember we were talking\n",
      "about this in the past few years\n",
      "of Pixels, all the best,\n",
      "the highest end flagships\n",
      "feels like they all have\n",
      "that super fast ultrasonic\n",
      "fingerprint reader.\n",
      "This one is still optical\n",
      "and still just a little bit,\n",
      "just a beat slower than the high end ones.\n",
      "It's not horrible, but you\n",
      "can tell it's not as fast\n",
      "or as consistently accurate\n",
      "with like rain on your phone\n",
      "as something like a Samsung phone.\n",
      "It's also not any bigger, either.\n",
      "But hey, as long as we're\n",
      "talking about the Pixel,\n",
      "we might as well just get\n",
      "right into talking about the camera\n",
      "because this is where you're gonna see\n",
      "the fix it in post pushed\n",
      "to its absolute maximum,\n",
      "more than any other phone.\n",
      "So the new camera\n",
      "sensors across the board,\n",
      "they do plenty of heavy\n",
      "lifting, of course,\n",
      "it's a big 50-megapixel primary sensor\n",
      "shared across both the 8 and the 8 Pro,\n",
      "F1.7 OIS and Pixel photos, they look good,\n",
      "they're sharp, there's tons\n",
      "of dynamic range as expected.\n",
      "Auto focus is really fast\n",
      "and it can get a pretty\n",
      "shallow depth of field\n",
      "with close up subjects, which is nice.\n",
      "But really most of what you're looking at\n",
      "when you look at a Pixel\n",
      "photo or video is software.\n",
      "So the multiple exposures blended together\n",

      "So sometimes details\n",

      "that it doesn't look\n",
      "terrible when zoomed out.\n",
      "And I've also found there\n",
      "is definitely a tendency\n",

      "anytime you take a group photo\n",

      "six people in the photo,\n",
      "you just blast, you just\n",

      "the samsung galaxy s3 is probably the most wanted android phone of the entire year 2012 samsung has delivered so without any further ado let's go ahead and take a look at the full review so this is samsung's flagship device worldwide so it deserves flagship worthy hardware and it gets exactly that on the inside of the united states version we have a 1.5 gigahertz snapdragon s4 dual core processor and a huge 2 gigs of ram there's also 4g radio inside and it features expandable storage via microsd all in a package that's just 8.6 millimeters thin and samsung has done something awesome and made every carrier's version identical to each other so accessories will work on all of the samsung galaxy s3's in the world and you can even exchange the backs of them for a cool like white on blue contrast look if you like and to top off all the spec sheet stuff which is actually detailed here on the back of the boxes you get software wise android 4.0.4 ice cream sandwich with the latest version of samsung's touchwiz ux on top and we have some things to say about that too the biggest new feature of them all literally is the new display it's a 4.8 inch hd super amoled display so 1280x720 an absolutely gorgeous display for a phone is it pentile yes but can you tell nope i mean this is a crystal clear super high contrast display with amazing responsiveness thanks to what's underneath a lot of people toss around the word pentile as if that means instant depth to a display but it's honestly you really can't tell unless you're looking at a much lower resolution of a pentile display first thing you notice when you're playing around with the galaxy s3 is what i like to call fluidity the smoothness of the user interface when you're flying around touchwiz it's literally unmatched by any other android phone i've been playing with the one x for a while the galaxy nexus for a while but these animations here all execute at perfectly high frame rates and that's not something i can say for every other android device and it just adds to that fluid experience there's not a stutter anywhere and this is the one reason why if i had to pick an android skin over pure android it would be touchwiz i mean it's the fastest it's the lightest of them all couple that with the two gigs of ram in the galaxy s3 and you're looking at a pretty freaking fast device touchwiz is also one of the least obtrusive in your face android skins that there are so the user experience is pretty close to stock android there are a few minor changes like the settings menu and that notification battery percentage indicator another thing is they replace the stock calendar widget and app with their own samsung themed one which is very different looking there are a few other pre-installed samsung applications too and depending on which carrier you go with in the united states you'll get a few more pre-installed application one thing that i actually found a little bit annoying is that the toggles in the notification area while they are really really handy and i'm glad that they're there the slide in animation that happens every time i pull down the notification tray like is that really necessary uh the wi-fi toggle is all the way on the left and it slides in from the left so that prevents me from being able to immediately toggle wi-fi like right when i pull it down so it's just a little bit annoying maybe just a minor complaint i suppose but something definitely worth mentioning the toggles themselves are pretty much all really useful and i'm really glad that they're part of touch was definitely one of my favorite features now that three button layout at the bottom some people love it some people really hate it actually some people don't like the home button that's physical at all honestly it really grew on me though actually after about five days of using the phone i kind of like it the the soft buttons disappear when they're not in use you know they perform legacy functions but they aren't there when you don't need them so that's pretty cool and you can access the multitasking still by long pressing that home button so honestly if you play with it and you don't like it at all give it some time you might actually find that you like it in the end overall there is a ton of samsung stuff built in to the software touchwiz that i could never cover like smart stay and just keeps the phone on when you're looking at it in motion and all this stuff but honestly most of it is pretty gimmicky s voice which is a freaking siri clone of all things can be just as useless as siri sometimes hi galaxy what is the capital of france didn't do anything i like the lock screen though which gives you the option to drag in apps to open them immediately and it gives you the ability to pick which apps you have here nice touch i always like the ability to open the camera quickly and speaking of camera the galaxy s3 has an amazing camera it blows the galaxy nexus camera out of the water and impressed me more than the one x's shooter i like saying shooter but it's an 8 megapixel shooter on the back it takes 1080p video it has sharp autofocus it performs well in low light which is great it takes stunning pictures for a phone and is totally capable of replacing your point and shoot okay hear that you no longer need to bring another camera on vacation or something you can literally just bring your phone i'm really happy it's gotten to this level of quality the quality is great the pictures and the features are plenty and it's fast it's really really fast there's a burst mode which can take like 20 pictures in a couple of seconds it's awesome very easy to use also up front there's a 1.9 megapixel front-facing camera for stuff like google plus hangouts and skype and face unlock nice so is it a worthy flagship from samsung it really is it's got the internals to support everything you throw at it from gaming to everyday use or to just heavy applications the battery life you get out of this is more than acceptable again miles better than the galaxy nexus you can get all day out of this guy easily and while the design may not be everyone's favorite it feels fine in the hand there's gorilla glass 2 on the front the device itself is very thin no need for a screen protector with that gorilla glass and the removable back gives you access to the internals the 2100 milliamp hour battery the sim card the sd card and this is some i never understand why people complain about the battery door being flexible because you should just put it back on the phone i've never seen one break under normal use anything you throw at this it can handle this phone is a boss it's one of the biggest and one of the baddest of them all it's the galaxy s3 so to launch such an awesome device on pretty much every us carrier and then some that would be verizon t-mobile sprint at t and u.s cellular they held some pretty awesome launch occasions or parties or something like that launch events and i went to the one that was in new york city and i got a lot of awesome footage from that where they were talking about the device where they were launching it where they were excited for it it was kind of their own version of a keynote they even poke fun at their competitors like some other companies have been known to do one of our primary competitors who likes to make a big deal of all the technology they've embedded their device has done a little more than launch a software upgrade and that time we've launched free devices that most manufacturers would be licensing to stand on as well to be their primary devices and that was actually the first time where i was able to see a us variant of the galaxy s3 i actually saw a whole bunch of them lined up together they all had uh their carrier branding on the back so it's pretty cool to see the verizon version in person even though it's actually technically not released yet so there you go the galaxy s3 is obviously a really really good device it's very impressive device to me both on paper because the specs are awesome it has two gigs of ram you know the lte for the verizon and sprint versions everything like that it's just a really great all-around device and then the experience on the other hand is also really good and for me it's actually enough to get me to switch from the nexus to the galaxy s3 on verizon as my full-time carry daily device so let me know what you guys think of it and obviously you can give a thumbs up on this video if you enjoyed it but do you guys think that the galaxy s3 is better than the other flagship devices out there i can obviously compare it to the htc one x if you like because that's obviously another quad-core device overseas compared to the quad-core version of this so let me know what you guys think if i should do some comparisons either way thank you for watching this video and i will talk to you guys in the next one you \n"
