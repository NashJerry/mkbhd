0,4JEZ2rrf2N4,Samsung Galaxy SIII Review!,2012-06-26T01:23:05Z,"{'viewCount': '575956', 'likeCount': '10110', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '2562'}",the samsung galaxy s3 is probably the most wanted android phone of the entire year 2012 samsung has delivered so without any further ado let's go ahead and take a look at the full review so this is samsung's flagship device worldwide so it deserves flagship worthy hardware and it gets exactly that on the inside of the united states version we have a 1.5 gigahertz snapdragon s4 dual core processor and a huge 2 gigs of ram there's also 4g radio inside and it features expandable storage via microsd all in a package that's just 8.6 millimeters thin and samsung has done something awesome and made every carrier's version identical to each other so accessories will work on all of the samsung galaxy s3's in the world and you can even exchange the backs of them for a cool like white on blue contrast look if you like and to top off all the spec sheet stuff which is actually detailed here on the back of the boxes you get software wise android 4.0.4 ice cream sandwich with the latest version of samsung's touchwiz ux on top and we have some things to say about that too the biggest new feature of them all literally is the new display it's a 4.8 inch hd super amoled display so 1280x720 an absolutely gorgeous display for a phone is it pentile yes but can you tell nope i mean this is a crystal clear super high contrast display with amazing responsiveness thanks to what's underneath a lot of people toss around the word pentile as if that means instant depth to a display but it's honestly you really can't tell unless you're looking at a much lower resolution of a pentile display first thing you notice when you're playing around with the galaxy s3 is what i like to call fluidity the smoothness of the user interface when you're flying around touchwiz it's literally unmatched by any other android phone i've been playing with the one x for a while the galaxy nexus for a while but these animations here all execute at perfectly high frame rates and that's not something i can say for every other android device and it just adds to that fluid experience there's not a stutter anywhere and this is the one reason why if i had to pick an android skin over pure android it would be touchwiz i mean it's the fastest it's the lightest of them all couple that with the two gigs of ram in the galaxy s3 and you're looking at a pretty freaking fast device touchwiz is also one of the least obtrusive in your face android skins that there are so the user experience is pretty close to stock android there are a few minor changes like the settings menu and that notification battery percentage indicator another thing is they replace the stock calendar widget and app with their own samsung themed one which is very different looking there are a few other pre-installed samsung applications too and depending on which carrier you go with in the united states you'll get a few more pre-installed application one thing that i actually found a little bit annoying is that the toggles in the notification area while they are really really handy and i'm glad that they're there the slide in animation that happens every time i pull down the notification tray like is that really necessary uh the wi-fi toggle is all the way on the left and it slides in from the left so that prevents me from being able to immediately toggle wi-fi like right when i pull it down so it's just a little bit annoying maybe just a minor complaint i suppose but something definitely worth mentioning the toggles themselves are pretty much all really useful and i'm really glad that they're part of touch was definitely one of my favorite features now that three button layout at the bottom some people love it some people really hate it actually some people don't like the home button that's physical at all honestly it really grew on me though actually after about five days of using the phone i kind of like it the the soft buttons disappear when they're not in use you know they perform legacy functions but they aren't there when you don't need them so that's pretty cool and you can access the multitasking still by long pressing that home button so honestly if you play with it and you don't like it at all give it some time you might actually find that you like it in the end overall there is a ton of samsung stuff built in to the software touchwiz that i could never cover like smart stay and just keeps the phone on when you're looking at it in motion and all this stuff but honestly most of it is pretty gimmicky s voice which is a freaking siri clone of all things can be just as useless as siri sometimes hi galaxy what is the capital of france didn't do anything i like the lock screen though which gives you the option to drag in apps to open them immediately and it gives you the ability to pick which apps you have here nice touch i always like the ability to open the camera quickly and speaking of camera the galaxy s3 has an amazing camera it blows the galaxy nexus camera out of the water and impressed me more than the one x's shooter i like saying shooter but it's an 8 megapixel shooter on the back it takes 1080p video it has sharp autofocus it performs well in low light which is great it takes stunning pictures for a phone and is totally capable of replacing your point and shoot okay hear that you no longer need to bring another camera on vacation or something you can literally just bring your phone i'm really happy it's gotten to this level of quality the quality is great the pictures and the features are plenty and it's fast it's really really fast there's a burst mode which can take like 20 pictures in a couple of seconds it's awesome very easy to use also up front there's a 1.9 megapixel front-facing camera for stuff like google plus hangouts and skype and face unlock nice so is it a worthy flagship from samsung it really is it's got the internals to support everything you throw at it from gaming to everyday use or to just heavy applications the battery life you get out of this is more than acceptable again miles better than the galaxy nexus you can get all day out of this guy easily and while the design may not be everyone's favorite it feels fine in the hand there's gorilla glass 2 on the front the device itself is very thin no need for a screen protector with that gorilla glass and the removable back gives you access to the internals the 2100 milliamp hour battery the sim card the sd card and this is some i never understand why people complain about the battery door being flexible because you should just put it back on the phone i've never seen one break under normal use anything you throw at this it can handle this phone is a boss it's one of the biggest and one of the baddest of them all it's the galaxy s3 so to launch such an awesome device on pretty much every us carrier and then some that would be verizon t-mobile sprint at t and u.s cellular they held some pretty awesome launch occasions or parties or something like that launch events and i went to the one that was in new york city and i got a lot of awesome footage from that where they were talking about the device where they were launching it where they were excited for it it was kind of their own version of a keynote they even poke fun at their competitors like some other companies have been known to do one of our primary competitors who likes to make a big deal of all the technology they've embedded their device has done a little more than launch a software upgrade and that time we've launched free devices that most manufacturers would be licensing to stand on as well to be their primary devices and that was actually the first time where i was able to see a us variant of the galaxy s3 i actually saw a whole bunch of them lined up together they all had uh their carrier branding on the back so it's pretty cool to see the verizon version in person even though it's actually technically not released yet so there you go the galaxy s3 is obviously a really really good device it's very impressive device to me both on paper because the specs are awesome it has two gigs of ram you know the lte for the verizon and sprint versions everything like that it's just a really great all-around device and then the experience on the other hand is also really good and for me it's actually enough to get me to switch from the nexus to the galaxy s3 on verizon as my full-time carry daily device so let me know what you guys think of it and obviously you can give a thumbs up on this video if you enjoyed it but do you guys think that the galaxy s3 is better than the other flagship devices out there i can obviously compare it to the htc one x if you like because that's obviously another quad-core device overseas compared to the quad-core version of this so let me know what you guys think if i should do some comparisons either way thank you for watching this video and i will talk to you guys in the next one you 
1,wXmzpFoHkfA,Samsung Galaxy S4 Review!,2013-05-01T00:50:25Z,"{'viewCount': '1842837', 'likeCount': '20389', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '3401'}",hey what is up guys I'm Kay PhD here and the Samsung Galaxy s4 will easily be one of the most popular phones of 2013 no doubt and when Samsung builds up that much hype for any phone like they do with the s4 especially when the predecessor the s3 is so popular we kind of expect the s4 to be a really good phone and a lot of people see the Galaxy s4 as an evolutionary update to the galaxy s3 and understandably so because of the naming but after my time with it I'm seeing it a bit differently I'm seeing the galaxy s4 as more of a downsized reconstructed note to hear me out so the galaxy s4 is more square than the galaxy s3 first of all and although it has very similar dimensions Samsung will tell you that it's slightly thinner and slightly lighter so that's true but you won't really notice these differences if you're familiar with the galaxy s3 you also feel right at home with the button layout and the port layout because they're the same on the galaxy s4 and they're also the same as they are on the galaxy note 2 but overall the phone just looks and feels just different different in the way the Galaxy Note 2 feels different from the s3 mostly because this design again it's more square and then you check out the insides you already know that you can take off the back the thin flexible plastic back of the galaxy s4 to reveal the internals and that will reveal a removable 2600 milliamp hour battery and a micro SD card slot and the speaker micro SIM card etc now compare this to the galaxy s3 on the left and the galaxy note 2 on the right and there is even more reason to consider the s4 a restructured note to the speaker is now down in the bottom at the same place the battery is also now lower in the chassis and the microSD card and micro SIM card slots are now above the battery instead of below all these like the note 2 not the s3 also on the galaxy s3 the edges were so tapered that you had no real edge of the phone to grip and that was a bit of a problem for me but with the new s4 design you actually have that metallic band around the phone that creates an edge to grip before the tapering starts it's a small touch and it's something a lot of reviewers look past as a cheap attempt to look more premium but it actually really changes the feel of the galaxy s4 in the hand you hold it so on the hardware side of things consider this guy a compacted Galaxy Note 2 that's just the way it feels in the hand and the way it's built on the software side of things though this is familiar Samsung territory so here on the galaxy s4 we have an updated TouchWiz on top of Android 4.2 jelly bean this time so first of all since it's Android 4.2 now you get a bunch of new google features like for example the quick settings in the notification bar that Samsung so generously colorized and added to they're accessible with a two finger swipe down from the top of the notification bar and you can basically customize them to let you one tap toggle any feature on the phone which is actually kind of nice it's convenient and you also get Android 4.2 S lock screen widgets and the first one I install it as dashclock of course because it's beautiful but yeah plenty of apps are supported you can swipe to the right to open the camera or swipe to add more lock screen widgets there a welcome addition that the Galaxy s3 and note 2 don't have yet and then there's the rest of TouchWiz so Samsung stuffed this phone to the gills with software features inside of TouchWiz a lot of them will make for great commercials and gimmicky tricks and neat demos so this one is very demo able which is very good for Samsung but in the end a lot of these features probably won't be used by the average user so for example air view is new it lets you hover your finger over an album in the gallery to get a preview of the photos inside it's useful it works but it's an extra gesture you have to learn and people are used to just tapping in an opening gallery anyway so I don't know if people will use that there's also things like smart scroll and smart stay and smart pause and all this smart stuff that's supposed to basically read your eyes using a front-facing camera and take action or adjust itself accordingly they all work most of the time but if you have them on by accident or you don't want them to be on you may find your phone scrolling up and down or pausing videos or changing orientation by itself when you didn't want or need it to do that so I ended up turning these features off after a while they got annoying and I just didn't need them and I did an explanation video of all these things so I'll leave a link right below the like button on this video if you want an explanation of all the galaxy s4 software features but basically overall TouchWiz has a lot of new added features that are like I said great for demos it's great for showing off to your friends or something like that but eventually I turn them off because they just weren't doing it for me I don't really need them overall though TouchWiz is still very colorful as we've seen on other devices and very very contrast II just like on the galaxy s3 and the note 2 and touch which is very contrasting because it's also on that M OLED display and speaking of that display this is no ordinary AMOLED display the galaxy s4 is rocking a 1920 by 1080 Super AMOLED plus display so that gives it a pixel density of 441 pixels per inch and it does have a pentile sub pixel matrix but nobody can tell this display has far more pixels in that 5 inch space than any naked eye can decipher and that means razor sharp text images video everything I love it it's what we've been waiting for it which what we knew was coming in the upgrade to the s4 and it is the number one reason to upgrade to this phone from something like the galaxy s3 now because it's an AMOLED display it also has a few advantages over other 1080p phones for example in deeper blacks higher contrast and lower power consumption but all of that comes with the trade-off that this display is no brighter than the galaxy s3 so it kind of struggles in daylight when compared to something like the HTC One but that's of course another video now it's pushing these pixels with the Snapdragon 600 processor in the United States which if you don't know is an absolute tank of a processor just a performance monster benchmark killer and all-around great chip so it's going to score really high on pretty much any benchmark that you put it through and it's also going to get you great power consumption as well so I was able to get all-day battery life again about the same battery life as the galaxy s3 with the stock battery I was using the galaxy s3 on Verizon which was an LTE network and I was using the galaxy s4 on AT&T which is now te network and I was getting about the same battery life so despite the more powerful processor and the bigger sharper display you're going to get about the same battery which is pretty good for me all day now you can't talk about that galaxy s4 without a little bit about that camera and I gotta say it is an awesome one I'd say the best camera on any smartphone I've ever used to date and that's including the latest iPhone 5 the Galaxy Note 2 the galaxy s3 the HTC One the Lumia 920 this tops them all for me this is just an awesome all-around solid performing 13 megapixel camera for pretty much all types of situations the camera app of course is updated to the new version of TouchWiz so it looks a lot like the interface on the samsung galaxy camera now and again it's filled with all these tons of gimmicky TouchWiz features that most people will never even know they have in their pocket but a few of them were actually kind of cool so people like to get creative with their cameras you know so for example I fell in love with the animated photo feature that lets you take a few seconds of video clip and then basically animate just a part of it to form a jiff and there are so many unique ways to use is it's not even funny I was walking around New York City all the time just taking these and the only real problem is sharing them because pretty much only Google+ supports gifs that big but it was very cool to use that feature and I also take HDR's a lot so it was good to see HDR make another appearance in this new version no photo spheres unfortunately kind of sucks since we're on android 4.2 and everything but yeah I guess they can get away with omitting that I'll include a full resolution panorama I took in New York in the description below so you can see the real quality because YouTube won't really let me show you just how good-looking the photos this thing takes are but trust me when I say they are beautifully sharp and detailed with all those pixels and definitely good with the color department too it's a solid performer in low-light as well it's no Lumia 920 it's no HTC One and low-light but it definitely produces acceptable photos and pretty much any lighting situation which lets me give it the crown of the best all-around camera in a smartphone so at the end of the day there are a lot of things to like about the sonne from the 1080p display to the battery life to the note 2 like squarish design to the things like you know the little TouchWiz improvements on top of Android 4.2 yet then again there are plenty of things not to like for example the Settings app which took a huge step down and currently sucks with this lame tabbed interface that you can't even swipe through to get but it's really all about your values on when it comes to judging things like that and the huge question at the end of the day is is it worth your upgrade is it worth your money to upgrade from the Galaxy s3 or from other phones and right now the verdict is if you have to have 1080p AMOLED then yes this is the way to go this is the only way to go if not then you might be better off waiting the software features you see here are basically around the corner and a firmware update from the galaxy s3 and the Galaxy Note 2 and other Samsung phones but what about other phones like the HTC One or other 1080p devices well there are some benefits to the galaxy s4 for example it's made of plastic which is a pro because that gives you a generally better signal strength you get a lighter phone a little bit thinner and you also get very fast GPS lock with a plastic back but then again there are cons like it being a fingerprint magnet and feeling cheap in the hand so overall that decision comes down to what you prefer in a phone overall though I think this is a great phone I'm definitely enjoying every second I spend with it and maybe you will too this is definitely worth checking out I think I would go with the black version over the white version though just for the clean look and less fingerprints either way thank you for watching definitely subscribe and stay tuned for upcoming videos that relate to this one very very very very soon and you're definitely going to want to see those so I'll talk to you guys in the next video ace you 
2,z8gOX35dAfc,Samsung Galaxy S5 Review!,2014-04-16T23:52:30Z,"{'viewCount': '2063716', 'likeCount': '32104', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '5275'}",[Music] hey what is up guys mkbhd here and this is the samsung galaxy s5 so right off the bat we can see this phone looks really similar to the galaxy s4 from last year it has upgraded specs inside of course which are virtually identical to the one m8 except for one or two things but it keeps a very similar design to the galaxy s4 though it is a little bit bigger now to fit that 5.1 inch 1080p display and slightly bigger bezels so awkwardly enough one of the biggest complaints with the new design is about the backing which a lot of people aren't a fan of i mean i called it i call the gold version of this phone the band-aid edition but basically it has all these little dimples across the back of this soft touch material turns out this is easier to grip and hold in the hand than the slippery metal of the htc one m8 so while the m8 might be a little bit heavier and made entirely of metal the s5 is easier to hold because it's lighter and the button placement is much better you got the power button on the side now so you don't have to shimmy your hand and it has actual sides to grip even though those sides are made of samsung's fake metal oh and the back happens to still be removable so you get not only micro sd card expansion up to 128 extra gigabytes but you also get access to that 2800 milliamp hour battery and something you might notice while taking that back off is this seal all the way around the inside of the cover of this phone this is to make the internals or the whole phone ip67 certified so ip67 the six means totally protected against dust and the seven means water resistant for limited periods of time which is useful to some people but you'll notice the seal does not go over the speaker which sounds alright but it maxes out pretty low in volume compared to the htc one but i guess you know everything is quiet compared to the one so the full video comparison between the s5 and the one are coming soon but bottom line is this thing is water resistant and a lot of people are gonna like that but also to protect the phone from dust and water they needed to add probably my biggest gripe with the design of the entire phone this freaking flap at the bottom that you have to pry off every time you want access to the usb port every time you want to charge it that means you can't use any battery cases because you have to pry that thing out the way all the time it just gets in the way when you're plugged in and to top it all off every time you unplug the phone from the wall it reminds you to close the flap every single time bottom line i'm not a fan of the flap although i guess it is necessary to keep that certification but other than that this is really a familiar design for anyone who's used previous galaxy devices especially the galaxy s4 and you'll notice they've changed the capacitive buttons up front so now really the only face change besides the bigger bezels is you have that multitasking button and back button so you can hold down the multitasking button to act as a mini button and right between those capacitive buttons is the fingerprint sensor slash home button i'm basically going to cover everything by saying it's not really that great first of all it makes the home button a little bit mushier and less clicky than before and second of all much more importantly you have to swipe your finger perfectly vertically along the center of the pad for it to work you don't just put your finger there you have to swipe it perfectly vertically for it to work so yes you can register a bunch of fingerprints and secure your phone or your paypal payments or whatever you want to do and it'll work if you take your time with it but it's difficult to use correctly and it's not always accurate when you don't swipe your finger at just the right speed at the right angle which does by the way require holding the phone with one hand and swiping with the other so you need two fingers to unlock your phone and sometimes i'd actually go to unlock my phone with the fingerprint on and it would work and then i'd unlock it a little bit later and it just wouldn't even work it doesn't even ask just lets me swipe to unlock and get in without my fingerprint uh and that was it so yeah i turned off the fingerprint recognition stuff before the end of the first day i used it really was a pain but anyway once you unlock the phone and get in you are greeted with touchwiz on top of android 4.4 and it's all right it's definitely not my cup of tea it's not my favorite but i prefer it to previous versions they definitely made some adjustments and cleaned it up and made changes that i like i know they've shaken that uh inspired by nature stuff from touchwiz on the galaxy s3 but they still have these nature sound effects these bloop and noises that i've disabled had to disable them pretty much immediately for my own sanity i wish they would clean up the sounds and actually i think that would have a surprisingly big effect on how you perceive the user interface but other than that thanks to the specs the s5 is pretty quick it's responsive there isn't really any lag in most places but when you do find lag like in the gallery for example it's bad like i mean for a high-end flagship phone with monster specs like this the phone really does have the slowest gallery so when you do find lag you'll notice it but touchwiz is pretty much exactly as you'd expect colorful big bold and constantly pushing samsung features one of those samsung features being my magazine which is the pain that sits to the left of your home screens like blinkfeed or google now and it's kind of this news aggregator like blinkfeed and just talks to flipboard basically pulls in some cool stories very beautiful imagery and uses the entire 5.1 inch display uh i mean it does what it's supposed to it's just a matter of whether you want it there or not also it can't be disabled or hidden like blinkfeed can now another notable thing here is the settings menu actually i i thought it was in my galaxy s4 review that i mentioned that samsung really needs to change the way they organize their settings basically because there were so many and they needed a search box but this is absolutely not what i meant i didn't mean put them all in a grid of 60 something colorful icons that i have to scroll through to find what i want holy crap there are just way too many for that so i maintain samsung should really find a better way to handle all of the device settings than this there's a grid view there's a list view either way there are just too many uh but yeah i don't know i guess touchwiz just isn't my favorite uh plenty of people will not have a problem with it at all obviously if you've used a galaxy s3 or you've used a galaxy s4 and you like it this experience here will be very similar and there are other plenty of new useful features the editable quick notification settings are really useful there's also feature called toolbox that lets you store any five apps in this bubble that you can move around and it gives you quick access from that bubble to those apps anywhere so no matter where you are you just tap it and it brings up your favorite app list it's nifty i actually left that on and use it for a quite a bit so these are the types of things that will get you to like the phone more and even if the things that you like aren't enabled by default you'll probably find something buried in the settings somewhere that you can turn on and make it a much more enjoyable user experience now i mentioned at the beginning of the video that the galaxy s5 has basically identical specs to the one m8 except for a few key areas one of those key areas is sitting on the back here of this phone you'll notice this lens protrudes from the body a bit it's that 16 megapixel camera this camera is excellent and i'll immediately go on record and say it's one of the top five smartphone cameras you can get right now it is very very good now maybe it's because i spent too much time with the four megapixel camera on the one m8 but basically the shots i'm taking i'm noticing a few key characteristics again here one very very detailed tons of resolution and detail at 16 megapixels and two they're very saturated photos and colorful in pretty much any conditions so the camera interface is pretty standard samsung stuff not you know too overly simple you know samsung likes to give you a ton of options there's lots of effects and things you can play with and change you can take 4k video you have software stabilization you have hdr the whole deal you have something here also called selective focus which again might ring a bell from the one m8 it's done a little bit differently here basically it instructs you to take a photo of something close with an out of focus background and it takes a pair of photos for you one that focuses on the foreground and one that focuses on the background but lets you pick between them using just one button for near focus or far focus but what i really liked was actually the pan focus button which actually lets you grab everything in focus at the same time which can actually be really useful and let you get a whole shot a whole composition right through some software processing so here we have another version you can see near focus far focus and then pan focus obviously it's not perfect and it's a pretty artificial effect but the ability to switch the stuff on the fly on your phone with a single button press is pretty neat i think a lot of people like that so basically i found myself taking a lot more pictures with the galaxy s5 just because of how good the camera looks how good the pictures look on the phone so there's an awesome display combined with a 16 megapixel shot and that really lets you grab detail from the smallest things and blow them up the images look really razor sharp now obviously if you zoom in a ton you'll see smaller imperfections and blurs but this stuff you'll have trouble doing on pretty much any other smartphone camera 16 megapixels gives you a lot of room to play with it's not 41 it's not 50 but you guys know i love pixels and it's awesome to see this much detail and color in a quick shot like this and the ability to shoot 4k video is a sweet bonus so nice job on the camera samsung but hold up a minute what is below the camera what is going on there that is not an extra depth sensor or anything fancy for imaging that is actually a heart rate monitor yeah a special hardware to measure your heart rate obviously s health is still a thing that samsung does so they've plugged into that sensor on the back of the phone and essentially if you hold your finger there for a few seconds it'll give you a reading of your heart rate in beats per minute now i don't actually know how accurate this is because i don't have another heart rate sensor to control but it's a neat feature it's a neat demo to bolster the s health uh portfolio of things it can do it's a pedometer and hurry monitor whatever it's s health so anyway yeah if you're not getting the picture by now basically the galaxy s5 is an improvement in a lot of ways over the galaxy s4 uh and a lot of smartphone enthusiasts tend to see that as i guess a bad thing because they really didn't like the galaxy s4 or they were expecting a bigger change but for the many millions of people who will inevitably buy this phone that's actually great the galaxy s4 was a solid phone and this phone improves on it in a lot of important ways so so what if this phone looks like a band-aid in gold get it in black or get it in white get it in blue you know it's great it's a high-end phone with a ton of features it's water resistant it has an excellent battery life that nobody should have any problems with it has a beautiful large colorful bright display easily the best amoled display in the business on a smartphone right now it's lightweight it's made of some cheap materials sure but you're coming from the s4 so you're probably not going to notice and really the only real downside i have with touchwiz is or with the galaxy s5 is touchwiz and it's quirks and i guess the speaker a little bit too but touchwiz will continue to evolve and right now the galaxy s5 really is the galaxy s4 s that i called it in my first impressions video so don't mind me i'm just going to sit back over here and quietly cross my fingers waiting for a google play edition of this phone because the new google camera came out today and it's great and i like stock android and i feel like i would really enjoy a google play edition galaxy s5 but in the meantime there it is this is the samsung galaxy s5 thanks for watching guys and i'll talk to you guys in the next one peace [Music] you

the full review of the samsung galaxy s7 so this is a phone that's similar in a lot of ways to its predecessor the one that came before it which would be the galaxy s6 so the easiest way to talk about this phone and to completely understand it is to look at all the differences between it and the one that came before it so this is everything you need to know that's new and different about the galaxy s7 so first of all the body is slightly different it's slightly upgraded and most people hear that to me and it got thinner but this phone is actually slightly thicker and i'm calling that the upgrade because it's allowing one a much smaller camera bump on the back and two a much smaller home button slash fingerprint reader bump on the front actually had a lot less accidental home button presses with this phone so that's nice and the phone is still pretty thin but the extra space inside is packing a much larger 3000 milliamp hour battery so that's pretty important and then they focused on the shape and the handle a little bit more so the edges are less sharp the phone is easier to pick up and hold and the back glass is more rounded on the sides like the galaxy note 5 and then the rest is all the same premium materials from last year so gorilla glass 4 on the front and back and then metal rails on the sides and really nice buttons i don't think samsung gets enough credit for how nice the buttons are they pretty much have the power button and volume buttons on point so overall you get the idea that the build is slightly improved but still very familiar in fact this is definitely still the slipperiest phone i've ever held or used alongside the note 5 like this has slipped out of my pocket while sitting in a car multiple times but yeah overall the shape and build of this phone is definitely one of those incremental improvements from last year okay the next difference is ip68 this phone is now totally dust sealed and water resistant so you can use it in the rain or near a pool or at a beach or get splashed or whatever it's fine and it does it all internally so there's no like weird flaps or anything over the usb ports or the headphone jack i love that the design stays the hit as it gets waterproof here the one downside is definitely the speakers the speakers suffer massively here pretty sure the galaxy s7 just got the biggest downgrade of any speakers on a smartphone they're now way tinier and more distorted sounding and you can blame that fully on the waterproofing so the galaxy s7 also got the micro sd card slot back i did not expect that to actually happen i threw that out there in an older like predictions video as a sort of a oddball feature that might happen but you do actually have it now you do have expandable storage in the galaxy s7 and of course you can't have a new flagship phone without all your new flagship specs and you get all of that here so in the us that's the snapdragon 820 chip adreno 430 and 4 gigabytes of ram and performance is definitely up to snuff to match this is a really quick and snappy phone again like the galaxy s6 was and we're getting much improved ram management as well that's big here i'm glad to see this phone handle multitasking that much better than its predecessor which kind of occasionally had issues holding apps and ram with metal and glass it still does get a bit warm even with the new internal cooling but nothing too severe just a little warm to the touch when you're gaming for a while or doing some heavy browsing but just with everyday use it's fine wireless charging heats up a bit but i'll talk about that later so yeah this phone is fast again that's one of its biggest strengths and definitely one of the biggest reasons to get it so the last but not least actually the biggest difference with the new s7 is the new camera this new 12 megapixel camera this is my favorite camera on any smartphone right now and that's putting it on top of a very good heap of other smartphone cameras out there and i gotta say there's no shooter that consistently makes me feel as confident as a photo and video taker as the galaxy s7 and that's what really makes a good photo experience for me so the camera app opens with that double tap of the home button really quick from anywhere again super fast and it's immediately ready for a shot there's no shutter lag or anything it's very quick to just grab a photo and a lot of people look at the new 12 megapixel photo number and think oh wait that's less megapixels than last year it's not a big deal 12 megapixels is still plenty and these pixels are now larger which along with the optical image stabilization and the huge f 1.7 aperture should help a lot with low light should uh the photo quality in auto mode is again very typical samsung so very bright punchy colors lots of saturation and contrast and sharpening they've been doing this forever so i get it one thing that's more notable is that f 1.7 aperture makes it so easy to blow backgrounds out of focus uh even in broad daylight with normal subjects if you get close enough to the subject you can get that blurry background which is pretty crazy and the new dual pixel autofocus handles this shallow depth of field really well pretty much always nails it so photos pretty much always look solid coming off this phone i'd say the biggest weakness is it tends to over expose a bit in daylight conditions there are definitely more blown highlights than crushed shadows although throughout the pictures i've taken it's actually not the best in low light here's an example of the exact same picture i took on the galaxy s7 versus my nexus 6p now nexuses haven't even always had the best image processing but it clearly beats the s7 here so i would have liked to have seen i guess less grain from the s7 camera and low light and a little bit more control exposure during the day here's the thing though that auto focus is the best part of this new camera and it's crazy fast also in video mode it's just as fast making this pretty much the ideal for high quality video if you want to shoot 4k video in the easiest possible way guarantee usable footage this phone is the one to have overall the fast autofocus combined with the fast aperture and the fast camera app make this the fastest smartphone camera alongside the iphone and it's a pleasure to use for that reason oh and that front facing camera is not bad also 5 megapixels and also an f 1.7 aperture and an even wider angle than the back camera it's not quite as sharpened or oversaturated but it takes a pretty good selfie if you're into that so there you have it a couple of incremental but important changes that make the galaxy s7 a different beast plus i guess all the things about the galaxy s6 that were already pretty great the best display in any smartphone the 5.1 inch quad hd super amoled that gets super bright the premium materials the fast home button fingerprint reader that's i think second only to touch id and some quick charging and wireless charging of a new larger battery and the actual life for me with a larger battery was really impressive too i would give myself like a b plus or a minus for as far as how long this lasts during the day pretty much never have to charge it before the end of the day and i was getting somewhere between five to five and a half hours of screen on time typically which is a big improvement over the notably bad battery life of the galaxy s6 so that's something i was really excited to see and you also still have fast charging you still have wireless charging you still have fast wireless charging it does get a little bit warm to the touch when you're wireless charging but other than that pretty much no complaints about the new battery now it's definitely not perfect it still has its flaws i made an entire video about that and if you want to watch that it'll be linked in this corner or below that like button and it's missing a couple things you know it doesn't have an ir blaster some people were confused about the dropping of that it's also like i mentioned the slipperiest phone ever and definitely looks and feels better with a case or even better a nice skin on it plus you kind of hide the fingerprints and make it easier to hold i'll link the dbrand skin below i think that matte looks clean and it's definitely still not everyone's favorite software so this samsung skin on top of android obviously since it's android you can still go to town with the skins and custom launchers and really make it your own but someone like me will do that within minutes of setting it up someone who's not really into it might take a while and might not like it out the box but overall i really like this phone some of the little stuff that used to be third-party apps samsung is picking up on it and building it into their own software so stuff like the always-on display is a nice touch so for example since it's always an amoled display you can choose to always have a clock calendar or still image when the phone is sleeping and it avoids burn in by moving around the display periodically doesn't burn too much battery i think it's cool if you use the calendar a lot it would be cool to have that always on i'm not sure why you'd want a still image but hey there's always that option but yeah it's taking a lot of stuff like this and adding it into their own software so if you don't find it on day one then you'll probably find it a little while down the road after using this phone for a while but at the end of the day the big question is is this galaxy s7 worth the upgrade over whatever phone you have now if you have something like a galaxy s6 or even a high-end phone from last year it might not be worth all the changes the couple of things you do get if you're really really into video this is the best video camera on a smartphone now and if you're really into having a better battery life this is definitely a better battery life than the galaxy s6 but if you're gonna upgrade if you have to and you're not really sure i would at least opt for the galaxy s7 edge which is a little bit bigger but you also get those edge features and you get an even larger battery for even better battery life overall a pretty well-rounded experience no pun intended that was totally intended so that's been it thanks for watching this review video hopefully you enjoyed it feel free to give it a thumbs up if you do and i'll talk to you guys in the next one peace you 
4,nNlTNE1y9DM,Samsung Galaxy S8 Review: The Ultimate Smartphone?,2017-04-18T21:34:47Z,"{'viewCount': '5450087', 'likeCount': '113541', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '12123'}",foreign [Music] hey what is up guys MKBHD here and a couple years ago in 2014 Samsung made a surprise product announcement called the Galaxy Note Edge with this crazy display hanging off one side and for a random unexpected phone it got a lot of attention since then that product has evolved again and again into Samsung's entire Flagship lineup which brings us to the Galaxy S8 so this new phone looks awesome and that's its Hallmark headlining feature is how good it looks and how well it's designed and then of course being a flagship it has all the bleeding edge specs inside and the hardware you'd expect from a premium Android phone so is this the complete package like the ultimate smartphone almost it's almost it's almost there so let me start by saying I love this phone's build like pretty much everything about the outside of this phone is premium and well built and awesome the display up front sort of melts over both sides and it does so smoothly into the back frame while last year's phone did it more sharply and if you want to talk about modern or about the future of smartphone design this year has been a shift to these really tall displays making these slightly taller candy bar shaped phones now the best part of these super thin bezels on all sides is that the footprint of the phone shrinks a lot so the 5.8 inch and 6.2 inch displays respectively on the S8 and S8 plus don't feel like huge phones even though they have huge screens in fact the S8 I think is a great size because it's so narrow I might have big hands but I think even anyone with regular hands can reach across to the other side of this display just maybe not all the way up to the top and I think the best indicator for this is the fingerprint sensor obviously there's no more room to put it up at the front of the phone so they moved it around to the back but instead of putting it somewhere in the middle of the back they put it right up there next to the camera now with most back fingerprint sensors they're a little lower on the phone for reachability just the way you hold the phone makes it easier now I think the top fingerprint sensor might look a little bit better in some cases but it is definitely harder to reach even with my larger hands I legit dislike this location I hold the phone with my right hand so I'm reaching the maximum distance up and over across the phone over across the camera with my finger and often I don't quite make it or I touch the camera glass instead or I only partially cover the fingerprint sensor and the reader doesn't unlock it doesn't work so this is through a week of using the phone I'm sure I could get used to it eventually but for most people this just makes it a two-handed phone and then you can end up just using the phone with two hands all the time now to be fair the glass over the camera actually does a good job deflecting smudges that come from errant fingerprint unlocks but honestly a clever way to get past this is with a case or better yet a skin actually so this is the skin from dbrand and not only is it better for gripping this all Glass phone but the tiny depth difference actually lets you better distinguish the fingerprint sensor from the camera on the back so fun fact highly recommended either way Samsung's word on this is now they provide you with a bunch of other ways to unlock your phone biometrically that don't use a fingerprint sensor mainly being the iris scanner and the face unlock now I didn't expect to like this answer mainly because the face unlock can literally be tricked with a picture of you so that's no good and the iris scanner usually requires you holding it up at a weird angle that you don't normally hold your phone which is a little awkward but this Iris scanner I think it might have a wider angle lens or the sensor has improved something about it is better because I don't quite have to hold it up at that awkward angle anymore and it does a pretty good job of unlocking my phone when I'm not like trying to I set it up I didn't expect to use it but a lot of times I just hold the phone up and start using it and it would unlock for me so that actually turned out to be a pleasant surprise either way aside from the awkward tallness of the phone and the fingerprint sensor the Galaxy S8 is the best industrial design of any smartphone in a long time in my opinion even though there are other phones out now and come coming soon that do the tall display thin bezels thing you still got to add on all metal and glass still has expandable storage through a Micro SD card slot still fully water and dust resistant ip68 certified so you can spill water on it and it's cool it still has USB type-c with Quick Charge still has wireless charging still keeps the headphone jack and the speaker is below average and downward facing it might be the worst part of the phone's build but that comes with the territory when there's no room on the front and you kind of want to water seal your phone so back to the screen it's incredible it is I would say the best display on any smartphone again it gets extremely bright so it's visible Outdoors or whenever and it's an OLED so of course it has fantastic color and contrast ratios and dynamic range and it's super high resolution too we're talking 2960 by 1440 on both phones actually so all that makes for an awesome media experience a great web browsing experience and great scrolling through Twitter and Instagram and seeing a lot of stuff at once experience and all of Samsung's software obviously he supports it perfectly now not every app in the app store fills the display right now right out the box like a lot of games especially will have to be updated or may just never fully support that so you'll either have the black bars on either side or you can punch in and of course most videos also aren't in this aspect ratio either so when watching a video you'll get the black bars as well unless you hit the button in the software to punch in a little bit but then you lose some of the frames so it's kind of your call it's give a little take a little for the slightly taller display but overall I'll take it I think the screen is awesome and with its curved edges and curved Corners I'm a fan and then there is the inside of the phone and since this is a flagship Samsung is again pushing things to the highest end of what's available except for one particular area but there's some pretty high-end specs in here Snapdragon 835 adreno 540 GPU four gigabytes of RAM at least 64 gigs of storage which like we said is expandable and this is the first phone to ship with Bluetooth 5.0 which I made an entire separate video about that just dropped highly recommend that so the performance aspect is pretty much taken care of the same way it always is great specs great speed and animations out the box but nobody has used this phone for a year or two yet so we'll have to see how the Samsung software ages and that's just what it is it's Samsung software on top of Android 7.0 and it has its pros and cons I actually like that it's adapted to be more like nougat with the swiping app drawer and the cleaner overall look especially of the settings app but it's really obviously still Samsung eyes with all the colors and some interesting quirks here and there with the paginated app drawer and the couple extra animations nothing too crazy or extra but it's not necessarily better than not having it the edge screen has gotten better there's now a couple features like from the note with smart select and the GIF maker where you can select part of your screen to make an animation or even take round screenshots all kinds of stuff that we didn't have before so you know this interesting stuff you can put in there I really like the extended screenshot feature where you can take a screenshot but then it gives you the option to scroll down and extend that as much as you you want so I'm really glad that made its way back into this phone but yeah overall it's familiar to anyone who's used a Samsung phone in the last two or three years both aesthetically and functionally now one of the biggest new features in the software Department of the Galaxy S8 is called Bixby you may have heard of it it's the virtual assistant that's built for this phone that just does a lot of what Google Assistant does now the circumstances surrounding it are interesting because Samsung put a dedicated button on the side of the phone just for launching it a Bixby button now a lot of people didn't like this for fair reason whether they didn't like Bixby or didn't want it so they found a way to use an app to remap the Bixby button to do whatever they want probably should have been in the Samsung settings in the first place you can make it the default for the button sure but in in regions where people don't use Bixby or Bixby is not supported or language supports not there yet or it's incomplete let them go on the settings and remap it to whatever they want it could be a legitimate useful separate feature well yesterday Samsung actually patched that up and blocked any remapping of that button at all on the Galaxy S8 so it's definitely now just a Bixby so understandably again people got kind of angry about that nobody wants accidental triggers of the app they want to never use but a couple of people were asking well hey what if what if Bixby is actually really great what if Bixby is amazing what if it's better than Google so I gave it that chance I didn't remap my Bixby button and I was using Bixby alongside this phone for the past week and I'll give you that so first of all the voice feature is not activated yet and it won't get added till later this year so that's a pretty rough start but aside from that it does show you some cards your gallery your upcoming calendar events maybe some weather some frequent contacts but then that pretty quickly devolved into a bunch of Samsung apps like themes and wallpapers and Flipboard and a bunch of stuff I don't use so really it's working in catch-up mode to be able to do all that Google does with Gmail and navigation cards and flight status and all that now the one place it did do some interesting stuff is in the camera app in the viewfinder there's a Bixby button that if you press it it can recognize images in the viewfinder and search for them whether it's images or if it's a product it will get you Amazon search to maybe buy it I've seen Google Goggles try this a couple years ago and with Bixby it was about the same pretty Hit or Miss sometimes it would get it and it would be pretty useful especially when there's a lot of text to it that I can recognize it just searches that text so it makes sense that it would work there other times when I thought it might get it nothing came up or it got it wrong with this Bluetooth speaker for example sometimes it got nothing sometimes it thought it was a baseball hat I don't know not sure how to get it to work better but no dice so aside from this biggest new software feature being kind of a swing and a miss on this phone I'm totally fine with the software on the S8 it's cleaner it's much more refined it's out of the way I like it now the camera on the back this has also been a bit of a source of discussion at first it wasn't really talked about and we kind of assumed it was literally the exact same camera as last year it has the same specs no dual cameras like some of its Rivals it's a 12 megapixel F 1.7 aperture dual pixel autofocus Optical image stabilization top-notch stuff again but yeah same as we've already seen but turns out this is a slay highly updated sensor with newer Optics so the images will look slightly different from the Galaxy S7 honestly most of the difference will come from better image processing but the photos and 4K videos from Galaxy S8 look fantastic as you would expect maybe leave a comment if you want a direct comparison to its predecessor but you can imagine you can see the sample is great detail great contrast color and sharpness are excellent and pretty aggressive auto HDR modes so dynamic range is also pretty wide rarely blows out the highlights like a lot of other phones would so of course it's a pleasure to take photos and videos with such a nice screen as a viewfinder we often say the best camera is the one you have with you I think this is no exception with this phone it'll be one of the best cameras you can put in your pocket again this year now battery life is one area where I would have wanted just a little bit more now this is Samsung we're talking about here and they just had one of their phones last year literally start exploding when they tried to push the battery to the limit so I almost can't blame them for playing it safe this year but yeah the 3000 milliamp hour battery on the Galaxy S8 I was testing pretty much barely got me through the end of the day maybe 10 left when I'm done and to be fair I'm pretty heavy on it I use it a lot bright screen lots of video watching taking pictures etc for the review but there are phones with definitely better battery life as I suspected the upside though is that it charges ridiculously fast I had a night where I went to sleep with 22 and I woke up in the morning with eight percent so that's pretty terrible standby time and I was gonna start the day with the battery dead but I threw it on the charger for about an hour left with a 100 battery no problem so you kind of pick your battles there uh Samsung just played it safe with the battery so at the end of the day the Galaxy S8 is awesome and it's so Samsung that this this project was born from the crazy like back burner pet project that was the Galaxy Note Edge and now every phone like this has this crazy Edge display and I'm glad they keep doing that stuff and you got to give Samsung credit for making a phone that can stand out for how good it looks in an era well this little mini era where so many phones are accused of all looking the same this one actually does stand out in a pretty awesome way and I like that a lot about it there may be little things you don't like about it little unmappable buttons little software quirks here and there maybe the speaker's not the best but as a complete package this is an awesome phone I recommend it I've said the word awesome so many times you probably can understand that I like this already and I'd recommend it I'll have links below for other stuff you want to check out but that's pretty much it thank you for watching talk to you guys in the next one peace [Music] 
5,Gzy_nCkn88U,Samsung Galaxy S9 Review: The Perfect... Samsung!,2018-03-20T03:31:02Z,"{'viewCount': '9149981', 'likeCount': '150698', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '14148'}",oh [Music] hey what is up guys mkbhd here and this may all look very familiar to you this is samsung galaxy s9 uh yeah this is definitely s9 and uh this is new you're probably wondering if it's worth your money for an upgrade you may also just be wondering if it's a good phone or not so i think the best way to describe this phone is it's a nearly perfect samsung phone so what i mean by that is if you've liked samsung phones in the past or you have an old samsung phone and you like what they do with the software with the great cameras with the awesome design with their build then this is the best and most complete version of that that they've ever made but conversely if you already don't like samsung phones like if slow android updates aren't your thing or you just don't like what they do with the skin then this isn't going to change your mind so it's a nearly perfect samsung phone so last year the galaxy s8 had the infiniti display this year again galaxy s9 has one of the absolute best displays in any smartphone sandwiched between even slightly thinner top and bottom bezels than last time and they've even done a slightly better job hiding the sensors and things in that top bezel so the black looks more seamless and that earpiece also now doubles as a second speaker front-facing speaker so you kind of have a bit of a stereo speaker thing going on here it's not quite the same obviously as two big dedicated front-facing speakers but at least now it's a bit louder and clearer if you accidentally block the bottom speaker which can happen you don't completely miss what's going on so it's better last year you also had usbc and wireless charging fast charging all that that is also all still here usbc fast charging wireless charging a headphone jack water resistance is great clicky buttons and just overall a plus build quality now it's still glass which means you're still going to get smudges so if you want to pick up a dbrand skin this new black camo might not make your phone invisible but it'll make all the smudges and scratches disappear and then the biggest change on the outside has to be obviously the fingerprint reader placement it's now in the middle instead of up at the top next to the camera and that makes a huge difference even more than people are giving it credit for it's perfect now it's raised slightly so it's easy to know when your fingers on it when you're not looking at it and registering your fingerprint is now just a slow swipe like you roll your finger down the scanner once which is actually really cool i thought it was a glitch usually you kind of you know you have to press it on the fingerprint reader a whole bunch of times to enroll your finger but during this phone setup you just roll your finger down at once and it's a hundred percent done that is awesome and then there's also now on the back of this phone a blood pressure sensor in addition to the heart rate monitor so the heart rate monitor is not new we've had that for a while you can measure your heart rate that's quick but the blood pressure sensor usually you haven't been able to do that with anything other than like the wrap and the tools in the doctor's office to actually get that reading in that number i wasn't able to get that reading with s health or any of the health apps on my phone but i like a really good video from dave2d on how exactly this works there's a certain way to get it to help you if you do want to use this phone to measure blood pressure but as of right now it's just a pretty cool new addition last year's galaxy s8 also had top-notch specs when it came out s9 here keeps that up and bumps it up too again for 2018. snapdragon 845 and four or six gigs of ram and this does definitely feel like the smoothest samsung phone yet it still doesn't match stock android you know there's still little performance hiccups like when opening up bixby for example and occasionally and some other samsung apps uh but in my couple of weeks with this phone that's about it everything else nearly matches pixel 2 and smoothness and i'm really happy about that and then there is all the samsung software uh again they're still really not shy about their colorful look on top of android so it's not going to change your mind if you already dislike the samsung stuff but it's all better it still has a ton of advanced features it added iris scanning from the note which is a little slower but more secure than regular facial recognition using the front-facing camera and there's also a new intelligent scan which combines face scanning and iris scanning basically using which one works better depending on light conditions so i'm really into the new fingerprint reader so i haven't necessarily used these as much but it's cool to have all the options it still has a bunch of samsung's big screen tricks and app shortcuts you still get the edge shortcuts and some more customization options with those sometimes with all the stuff it can feel like samsung is just kind of dumping as many features as possible on you and maybe they are but that's part of what they do it still has bixby and the bixby button and everything bixby's good for okay i could have just disabled the bixby button from day one i know that but i decided to give it another chance i've left it enabled since day one every day using bixby and it's still not that great not only have i triggered it a couple times on purpose but many times by accident when taking it out of my pocket and every time i open it i just kind of scroll down hoping to find something useful in these cards uh but usually i don't so then i close it bixby voice can still do a lot of those like really intricate digging into the settings and longer strings of commands in the phone that other assistants can't do as well so that's pretty cool so uh turn on the flashlight so if you're into that if that's something you do on your phone often you'll like bixby when it understands you but i'm not that person so i'm gonna go ahead and disable it for now so yeah this is clearly still unapologetically a samsung phone in a software department for better or for worse there's still two browsers out the box two smart assistants two calendars two messaging apps all the classic half-hearted samsung ecosystem push is still there but it's also android so you can get rid of that stuff that's annoying if you don't want it battery life i think is the biggest weakness of these new phones the s9 and s9 plus it's not terrible but among all the other great things about these phones the battery life is definitely not great so i spend most of my time with the s9 plus which has the bigger screen but also bigger battery 3 500 milliamp hours and it would be dead by the end of the day and most of my heavy use days with a lot of navigation a lot of music playing a lot of screen on time watching videos and social media that would be enough to kill this phone in a single day i don't even do that much mobile gaming but if i were that would kill it too the upside of that as it always is with samsung is fast charging and wireless charging it charges really fast with the right charger the one in the box of course uh or one of several other usbc chargers like the macbook pro charger but it can be kind of picky the dash charger for example didn't work if you're curious but being able to top up really quickly during the day for me i've said this before it does offset the slightly weak battery this phone has it would be great if it had better battery but for me that's good enough depends on who you are and then for the biggest most reimagined new change in these phones that would be the camera let's break that down so there's a new 12 megapixel camera on the back and if you get the s9 plus it gets the second telephoto camera as well and it's the first modern smartphone with a variable aperture camera it can physically switch between f 1.5 and f 2.4 depending on your lighting so it defaults to f 2.4 which is roughly average for a smartphone camera actually and that's for your sharp normal daylight photos most of the time when you do get to low light under 100 lux that's when it's going to switch to wide open f 1.5 technically speaking the mechanism to do this is really impressive but it only matters if you can see the difference in photos so does it make a difference so alright generally photos from the galaxy s9 camera are pretty damn good photos are a little bit less over processed and a little less over sharpened than they used to be but it's clearly still the samsung look we're used to with the bright vibrant colors dynamic range i'd say is the most noticeable improvement but that's something they've actively worked on so it's good to see something you'll notice looking through all of these though is samsung's tendency to overexpose still pretty much every photo i take on the galaxy s9 in auto mode is just a little bit too bright it's just just a little bit but then it can also be a sort of an advantage when you take it to low light galaxy s9 low light photos look pretty good and that really is thanks to the f 1.5 aperture letting in way more light so the question of is this variable aperture making a difference well low light shots have seen a real bump up there's less smoothing because it gets rid of less grain because there's less grain because there's more light being led into the camera so fundamentally yes it's working it's still not the best camera in any smartphone though that's still pixel 2 hands down and i'd say it still falls a little bit behind iphone 10 but i don't think anyone will be disappointed with the third place performance of a great galaxy s9 camera something people have also noticed recently is it shoots video in the rec 2020 color space instead of rec 709 that's what happens when you turn on or leave on hdr if you turn that off they can be rec 709 so it's trying to look better again and more saturated on the samsung displays but you can turn that off so all right back in the impressions video i did mention that it seems like galaxy s9 plus will have a pretty big advantage over the regular galaxy s9 because you're getting now more ram more screen more battery and more camera so it turns out most of this isn't actually that big of a deal in the more ram department yes galaxy s9 plus has six gigs of ram while the regular s9 has four gigs of ram both are plenty hardly ever gonna notice the difference in regular everyday use could be nice for future proofing though the s9 plus obviously has the second telephoto camera for live focus and for optical zoom sometimes may or may not ever use that if you do obviously go with s9 plus but you might not miss that and then of course the size difference means your 5.8 inch display versus 6.2 inch and then your 3000 to 3500 milliamp hour battery again both of which are somewhat mediocre so not a huge difference between them so it's a toss up if you're choosing between them but i think the biggest thing i got out of this galaxy s9 plus existing now at this price point is there's way less reason to buy a galaxy note 8 right now the note 8 is really all about the stylus and it comes in at about a thousand bucks i would definitely pick the s9 plus over that because of the lower price even though you get a slightly smaller screen all the same advantages are there if you don't use that stylus and even a lot of the other reasons people might have gone towards the galaxy note in the past like your media experience the huge screen this tends to do a lot of that just as good if not better since you also get stereo speakers but that's just if you're picking between samsung phones my point from the beginning of the video stands this is just about the optimal samsung phone that you can get right now with all the pros and cons that come with that you get all the pros and up sides of the samsung experience taken to the max the awesome displays the a plus build quality the checking of pretty much every box stereo speakers headphone jack expandable storage and a pretty damn good camera but you also get all the cons of the samsung experience too your double apps your slower android updates your occasional hiccups bixby so this thing really is great it's perfect for the samsung lover but i as you probably already know am not that person i will be switching back i think to my pixel 2 as a daily so with the galaxy s9 it makes it really easy to under appreciate it because it seems like you know oh it's just a minor upgrade it's not that much better it's like an s8s and you could say it's a jack of all trades but the master of none but that's actually what makes this phone so good first of all it is the master of one the display there isn't really any better than this but it's actually so good at so many different things and bad at so few things especially being so good at the hardware suite that's what makes this phone so easy to recommend and so i do i recommend the galaxy s9 it's really good so either way that's been it thanks for watching talk to you guys in the next one peace [Music] 
6,tn2AgrwXpNQ,Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra Review: Problems Solved!,2021-01-21T16:01:07Z,"{'viewCount': '6542425', 'likeCount': '195658', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '12106'}",foreign do you remember when Samsung spent an entire three minutes straight in the keynote just talking about the matte black color I get it [Music] hey what's up MKBHD here and this is a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and it's an incredibly good phone I gotta say now the thing is not only does it do a lot on paper because we already know about the big numbers the huge specs the ultra story that's all still here but it does a lot of stuff that doesn't show up on the spec sheet a lot of subtle tweaks and changes that turn this from a really good phone to a great one so of course I gotta start with the Finish because well I've been saying matte black everything for a solid couple of years now to the point where it's it's on a shirt my car probably my most precious possession is wrapped in matte black and its name is Phantom so I guess you could say this Phantom black Galaxy S21 Ultra the matte finish kinda speaks to me and like I said it's not going to be on the spec sheet but this is a really nice finish it's a really very clean flat smooth black finish on glass and then with a slightly different texture on the metal housing around the cameras and then it turns into your typical glossy black around the edges but just the whole look of this phone to me is very intentional I'm on record saying I actually really like it and that was my first impressions video and I'm sticking by that just the way the camera module curves into the body of the phone the way it looks like like an overlay of another S21 Ultra on top of the first one really the worst thing about it is that it's still uneven so it still rocks on a table but everything else about this design I think is as good as it gets I was kind of worried it would look great out the box actually and then just collect a ton of fingerprints and look awful but this map black has been shockingly good at rejecting fingerprints so that's sweet something you might have noticed also is Samsung has a carbon fiber weave in the camera module for like every other color of this phone except for Phantom black for some reason but luckily for less than two bucks Channel sponsored D Brands got you covered with a carbon fiber camera skin so you can still get that look easy so okay now that I'm done raving about the design the Galaxy S21 Ultra as a sequel to the s20 ultra it's actually largely the same phone it's got a lot of the same big numbers the ultra stuff is still here but there's a lot of small intangibles a lot of small adjustments that they've made that I really like probably more than you think and then like I don't know how to say this without sounding kind of full of it but I feel like this phone was designed by or maybe at least worked on by people who have watched MKBHD videos does that make sense like there's there's a lot of things in here and of course there's a lot of people out there who have the same tastes and will like a lot of these changes in any phone but yeah this this exact phone feels more like an MKBHD Edition phone than any phone I've ever reviewed so you got to start up front with that display this has been a strength of Samsung and their phones for years so you can expect good stuff and you see that with the improvements on paper right this is a huge OLED that will finally do 1440p resolution and 120 hertz at the same time it gets even brighter up to 1500 nits tops so it's viewable in pretty much any conditions and the new ltpo panel Tech makes it actively vary its refresh rate between 10 Hertz and 120 hertz to save battery but from my experience has stayed very responsive I've never noticed a dip in frame rate in everyday use so it's managing it really well which is a success but even with all that stuff that's on the spec sheet there's also all the stuff that's not on paper like the fact that they keep flattening the display even more than last year this one doesn't spill over the edges kind of at all anymore obviously like that it's also a little bit smaller and the body of this phone it's still a big phone don't get me wrong but it's not like stupid big like here it is compared to iPhone 12 Pro Max another pretty big phone but it's actually a smaller footprint here and next to the OnePlus 8 Pro it's still huge but doesn't seem so overbearingly massive right it's actually smaller than the Galaxy s20 Ultra going from a 6.9 inch to a 6.8 inch display and also the fingerprint sensor is new I guess that would be on paper too but they've switched to a newer generation Qualcomm under display fingerprint reader and that reader is noticeably bigger it's 1.77 times the size of last year I didn't notice it being any faster even though it claimed to be but just the larger sensor area by itself makes the experience of using the fingerprint sensor all the time much less frustrating I have less failed attempts it feels less finicky and maybe someday the whole bottom of the phone will be a fingerprint sensor but until then in this world of wearing masks the improved fingerprint reader is welcome so also on paper Snapdragon Triple Eight inside 12 or 16 gigs of RAM depending on which spec you get fast ufs 3.1 storage not expandable which is technically a downgrade from last year but it's something I haven't personally used in a long time then High refresh rate display and a 5 000 milliamp hour battery so this phone is clearly a flagship performer on paper but off paper there are a lot of improvements to one UI three on this phone that do probably make a more meaningful difference to the user experience versus just the bleeding edge specs now I've said before I'm not the biggest fan of Samsung's software and their UI honestly I I've preferred close to stock maybe oxygen OS is my favorite non-stock option but you can't sleep on Samsung software the whole reason they do what they do is to offer as many features as possible and they are still at it there are tons of features packed into these phones that have a lot of potential for customization and just letting you tailor it to behave the way you want you never have to dive in and use any or all of the features because there's a lot but they'll be waiting for you if you have the time to mess with them I think the stuff you'll first notice with S21 Ultra is the new volume control here those sliders just a little cleaner looking and one ui3 the new notification grouping on top of Android just an overall cleaner aesthetic and organization to things like that the stock apps and the improved dark mode that I highly recommend looks great on this OLED display and can actually net you a little bit of extra battery life but also the Google discover page to the side of the home screen and Samsung's launcher what who told them to do that I did not see that coming but hey if I worked at Samsung and I kept asking for a Google Play edition for all these years I guess we know that's probably never going to happen again but this is a little taste to that it's as close as it's going to get I do kind of wish the search box showed up over here too like it does in the Google app but hey this is solid and I guess if they let me map Bixby to Google Assistant all over the phone that would have been the cherry on top but anyway speaking of battery we again have an ultra number it's 5 000 milliamp hours and that looks great on paper right in practice I've had a very good battery experience now the thing to note which is an ongoing conversation is the Qualcomm Snapdragon chip experience versus in other regions there's an exynos version so this year with this phone it would be Snapdragon Triple Eight versus the exynos 2100. now the initial testing results show a pretty promising basically for those who haven't known or haven't been filled in uh usually the xnos version is much worse with battery life and performance in those regions initial testing is uh pretty promising for the exynos 2100 I'm going to leave that actual conclusion getting to people who can get their hands on both phones but for now with my experience on the Qualcomm phone very good battery life on one day I got four hours of screen on time and ended around 50 percent the next day I had around five hours had a little less at the end of the day I never once killed it in a single day it's pretty clear that the combination of the Triple Eight chip and the ltpo display Tech are working well here I'd say it has what I'd call a worry-free battery don't even really have to think about it too much with some super heavy use and navigation and bright screen Outdoors all the time and gaming taking lots of photos and videos and maybe maybe you'll get to the end of the battery but hey while we're here let's talk cameras they are a big part of the ultra a phone experience both figuratively and literally speaking so they hit all the check boxes of big Ultra numbers again 108 megapixels 100 times Zoom 8K video all that stuff is still here I would say the experience has actually changed more than the photo quality photo quality is still roughly what we'd expect from a high-end Samsung phone and I'll get to that in a second but there are more changes to how you get to that photo and video that are better there's countless examples of this so right when you first open the camera app Samsung asks you if you want to take Natural or bright selfies instead of just defaulting to Bright all the time I'm glad they added that option they didn't have to but that results in much more natural selfies from that 40 megapixel camera for someone like me with my skin tone right off the bat instead of having to mess with the exposure slider then the 100x space Zoom which yes is definitely extreme and probably still a gimmick to most people it got a lot more stable and easier to use thanks to the subject locking in the viewfinder so now when you're zoomed all the way in on something the camera tries to identify the subject of the photo you're taking and locks the viewfinder to track that instead of shaking around so much it is slightly annoying when you're like locked on to something that's not quite what you're trying to shoot and then you have to try to adjust it probably zoom out and zoom back in but when it correctly picks your subject it's great the results are still insane and not super usable but hey if you were using 100x before you'll be happier with how much easier it is to use in this new version you of course have the laser autofocus added to fix the autofocus issues we saw with the s20 ultra and I'd say in 75 percent of cases it works it sometimes still humps a little bit with the really close up subjects but for the most part it's solved and then the camera app also now Auto detects when you're trying to take an extreme close-up and switches to macro but it's not a separate macro camera as you may have noticed this phone doesn't have one because it doesn't need one it uses the ultra wide camera which has autofocus and a super close minimum Focus distance so it actually takes really solid quality macros and it does 4K 60fps video from all the cameras now including the selfie camera and it'll shoot 12-bit Raw photos in Pro mode which is an awesome capability that I I'll probably rarely actually use personally kind of like the 108 megapixel mode but it's definitely a nice to have they even added things like the director's view which lets you record video from multiple cameras simultaneously which is enabled by the Snapdragon Triple Eight potentially really useful for Vlog style shooting and the use of two telephoto cameras a 3X and a 10x seemed peculiar at first but I've found it actually makes a lot of sense so like I could live without the 10x and most people also could and the s21s don't have it and that's fine but Samsung's committed to offering that quality super far zoom on this phone so if they did the 10x by itself and not the 3x well then everything from 1X to 10x would be digital zoom on the main sensor and that's not ideal so if they only did the 3x and not the 10x well then everything from 3x in that super far range wouldn't be quite up to the ultra standard so they have a 3X and a 10x and so now everything from 1 to 3x is zoom on the primary camera everything from 3x to 10x is either on the primary or the second camera just depending on what the lighting situation is and then everything from 10x and Beyond is of course on that little Periscope camera and that's delivering some of the best 10x to 30X Zoom photos that I'm seeing on any smartphone so that's accomplishing what Samsung set out to do now is it perfect no no camera's perfect it still misses shots it still does 8K at only 24 FPS the wrong frame rate and most notably it definitely still fringes on the edges with close-up subjects absolutely but overall they've controlled it a lot more with color and HDR and focus and so overall the look is what you'd expect just you easier to get so at the end of the day when you go down the list with the S21 Ultra they did it like this this is the phone that would have come out the lab if you handed me an s20 ultra and said all right go ahead and make any improvements you want this is what I would have made I would have updated the design I would have flattened out the display I would have added a little Google flare to the software the improved camera experience and I would have spent way too much time on a matte black finish and named it Phantom black it's kind of the best they've ever done oh and one more thing you might have seen some shots throughout the video of the limited edition icons drop that I did with the brand a few weeks ago I've also noticed a lot of you guys on Twitter who uh missed out on that limited edition drop so I've been working with the brand on this for a while behind the scenes and now you guessed it icons is back and it's not just limited this time it's back permanently so for all 150 plus devices in their category icons will live on forever in red and black and triple black but then also this is more than just a re-release because we're adding a few things we're adding that red and black mask you saw red code mask and we're also adding a new limited edition colorway called silicon so it's the matte black finish with a matte metallic paint for all the icons looks pretty hot if you ask me now if you're somehow watching this in the future sometime where silicon is over that limited drop happened and you missed the train so sorry but there's also some more limited edition color ways planned in the future so definitely let me know in the comments what other sort of colorways you want to see for icons either way that's been it Galaxy S21 Ultra very impressive phone very close to what an MKBHD Edition might look like what do you think of this phone and also what do you want to see in the S21 review as that will now be in the works either way that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace 
7,vXIAB_1FEC0,Galaxy S22 Ultra Review: Separating from the Pack!,2022-02-22T23:57:42Z,"{'viewCount': '5758691', 'likeCount': '157025', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '6928'}",[Music] hey what's up mkbhd here and this is the brand new galaxy s22 ultra i've been using it for about two weeks now and i promise you i'm not going to call this the note 22 ultra over and over again in this review i swear i can make it through this video without making that joke but really the bottom line here to understand this phone the best really is like if you took the name off of this phone what samsung is giving you for the money is a galaxy note but the phone that i'm reviewing and using is called the s22 ultra let's get into it so the word ultra in samsung's lineup has basically come to just mean the highest ambitions the biggest numbers the best specs and the most features overall it's just that now the ultra name has swallowed up the note stuff too so note used to be that one special edition phone with the squared off design the flat top and bottom and the pen built in now that's just all wrapped up into ultra and the s22 ultra does not miss a beat with all the ultra stuff they're packing in the highest end ship they can that's the snapdragon 8gen one here in the us with a massive new cooling solution alongside it the ram is technically down from last year the base model has eight gigs and all the rest have 12 and there's no more 16 gig version but i honestly don't miss that i can't imagine someone really needing 16 gigs of ram in their phone right now but you absolutely can go up to one terabyte of non-expandable storage though but this display this display is also excellent it's a huge 6.8 inch 1440p ammo led at 120 hertz with a 240 hertz touch sample rate and the big new number is a max brightness of 1750 nits now on the one hand i don't want to overreact about 1750 nits like it's a big number but brightness works on a logarithmic scale so this 1750 is not dramatically brighter than the 1500 max from last year's s21 ultra these phones are all very sunlight readable but i do still want to give samsung credit for continuing to improve an already best-in-class display and making it even better it still got the same great ultrasonic fingerprint reader as last year right under the middle of the screen and still has a hole punch camera in the top middle and it's an ltpo2 panel now which means in addition to being really responsive it can drop that refresh rate as low as 1 hertz when there's nothing moving on the screen really my only dislike with this display is the curve over the edges so if you look at this phone next to last year's s21 ultra obviously these phones are different shapes and the displays are actually slightly different resolutions and this new shape definitely curves more over the sides which i don't like as much other than that this is an awesome ultra display and we all know it's not an ultra without a massive battery so yeah 5000 milliamp hour should do the trick now interestingly there are some tests online showing that it doesn't last as long as last year's 5000 milliamp hour battery and you can see a roon mister who's the boss did a variety of things in his test and found the s21 ultra did last a bit longer than this phone and to me when i see that i'm like okay there's a variety of factors that can contribute to that one the slightly better display two a little bit more of a power hungry chip that runs hotter in the snapdragon 8 gen 1 but generally my battery experience has been very very good i actually never killed it in a day never really got anywhere close easily ending heavy days with 30 40 plus percent battery left and could extrapolate about seven hours of screen on time out of a charge which is great for me i know screen on time is different for everyone but it's been great plus on top of that it does charge a bit faster than last year up to 45 watt peak charging if you buy that fifty dollar optional brick so i'm glad they fit that big 5000 milliamp hour cell in here despite also adding the s pen which takes up a whole column along the inside of the phone but speaking of that s pen that's what's new the note stuff now i'm personally not the biggest s pen user i think i say this every time i review a note like i think i signed one pdf last week with it which was really convenient but you know i did it once and i used samsung's handwriting recognition in the notes app super cool that it works really well and you can search what you've written and i also i just enjoy that it still clicks a lot like that so it is definitely impressive i still think it's the best stylist in any phone and it's literally got all the features the last notes had smart select is nice for screenshots and annotating things lock screen quick notes are still super convenient if you use samsung notes and it even still has that long distance bluetooth connection that lets you use the button on the s pen to remote control take photos without touching the phone and the new display brings latency down from nine milliseconds which is already pretty good all the way down to 2.8 milliseconds which to me basically feels like real time you know i'm not an artist who's doing massive drawings or extremely precise sketch work with the pen it's just casual writing and so the fact that it uses ai to predict where the pen is going to go and starts drawing those pixels slightly ahead of where the panel is actually registering it is pretty next level so to me this this is as close to one to one as it gets but at the end of the day if you see all this and you're like i still probably won't really use any of it then you can just slot the pen right back into the phone and never use it it's out of the way and the phone didn't make any sacrifices to include it so okay here's a bunch of other smaller things that i noticed from using this phone every day that you should too if you're planning on getting one so the speakers are excellent they get very loud and sound crisp and clear like last year some of the best in any smartphone so that's great for watching media but then the display curving more over the edges than last year makes it worse for watching videos and then the vibration motor this is a small thing but i mentioned it also in the s22 review they changed the type so it went from a z-axis vibration motor to an x-axis vibration motor it doesn't sound like much but it changes the way it feels so it feels just as strong and precise and clean for typing or swiping or holding it in your hand but it's way less strong when it's on a desk or in your pocket so i literally missed phone calls with my phone sitting right in front of me vibrating on my desk because i didn't hear it or feel it [Music] then the camera rings so they're a bit of a controversial design sure but like most designs you kind of get used to looking at it but you never ever fully get it clean of dust so if you go caseless like me not only does the phone sit kind of funny on a table but there will also always be dust between the camera rings so just get ready for that i would actually recommend if you get a case channel sponsor dbrand just dropped their atomic edition grip case and it doesn't do a huge cutout all the way around the cameras like i thought we might see in my impressions video it actually just matches the camera rings and it looks way cleaner and it's just deep enough to protect the cameras if you drop it so this is definitely the way to go you can check it out at the link below then this phone just like the other s22s shoots 8k video at 24 fps you know the wrong frame rate give us the option for 30 samsung just put it in the settings somewhere but even worse than not having the 30fps toggle it actually crops in way more than the regular s22s so turns out shooting 8k is 33 megapixels and it's actually cropping in to the middle 33 megapixels of this huge 108 megapixel sensor so when you switch to 8k you zoom in to what feels like about 2x which is pretty inconvenient for framing no ak video from the ultrawide or the telephoto lenses this is a bit of a downside and then there is absolutely still some shutter lag with this main camera more than the regular s22s again and this is understandable with all the processing happening but it definitely felt like i was missing some shots or having trouble capturing moving objects because of the bit of a delay between the shutter press and the actual photo being taken but speaking of cameras let's just get the camera stuff out of the way it's funny because this is probably what most people actually come to these review videos for if you think about it if you watch a smartphone presentation these days 75 of a new phone presentation today especially a flagship is camera stuff so that's one of the biggest things that differentiates these phones and on a 1200 phone it's one of the most important features so how is it well you can see they went with basically the same layout of this set of cameras as last year it's 108 megapixel primary camera the ultra wide the 3x telephoto and the 10x telephoto plus laser autofocus and they're not the same exact hardware as last year but they're pretty close and that's a good thing and samsung is not messing around with their cameras these are definitely flagship quality and i'm really happy with them matter of fact i don't even have much to say about image quality because there really isn't much new here but there are some new features within the camera modes that might sort of unlock some new things and be different about this phone so i'm gonna go over those with you one by one so first the more accurate portrait mode now i think i tweeted a couple months ago sort of ruffled some feathers but i said something like samsung has the best like portrait mode on smartphones right now and i understandably ruffled some feathers but i should clarify basically what i mean is their cutouts have been the most consistent and the most accurate of portrait modes among smartphones that i've seen so that doesn't mean the the blur is the most natural or the falloff is the most realistic i just mean they make the least errors with like ears and hair and shirts and stuff and so this year they're planning on well they've announced that they're doing it even better they've got ai stereo depth mapping for portrait mode that they claim can cut out things as small as a single human hair which would be cool it's not exactly accurate but they say it's better so i still found it to be really good but it's definitely not perfect it still misses some stuff sometimes but i stand by my statement these cutouts and depth mapping they're doing is really really good the portrait mode shots especially look good with the 3x lens with people with pets even and also with inanimate objects that still does a good job cutting stuff out again not perfect you'll pretty much always find some error in every smartphone portrait mode shot but samsung does a really good job i think the 1x portrait shots are good to have but they don't look as natural so i hope samsung works on the naturalness and fall off of the background blur to overall make it the best portrait mode then there is night photography which samsung has called nightography okay so i compared the night mode shots to the iphone 13 pro which also has an excellent camera and my biggest takeaway is yes samsung's night mode photos are definitely more detailed 100 but they're also dramatically brighter as advertised they're letting in a lot of light and the photos in the dark look like you're taking them in a lot more light than you actually have especially look at the sky back there so it's impressive but it's also a bit of a preference thing some people want their nighttime photos to look like they're at night but then lastly there is an expert raw app separate from the camera app that can take raw photos that includes multi-frame computational photography data hdr and everything and the differences are subtle but they absolutely do allow for more latitude when editing so photographers should definitely grab this app from the ugliest app store i've seen in a while the samsung galaxy store so i'm going to end it with this you know typically the big question with the review at the end of the review you're like well should i buy it is it worth it and this is an expensive phone it's 1200 bucks so that's a big question so basically i think their mission was accomplished the fact that they combined the note stuff with this phone makes it easier to separate from the regular s22s it makes it a more obviously different phone in the lineup so if you just want like a standard really good flagship phone big screen nice battery nice cameras all that stuff the s22 plus is a great phone and it's 200 less at the starting price but if you want some specific extra things like the super high resolution display or the s pen or some of those camera tweaks then that gives you a reason to upgrade and it does deliver on those extra things now that being said i am sticking with the galaxy s21 ultra as my main daily driver phone obviously people who have this phone don't need to upgrade but it's just basically the same phone as far as software battery cameras are almost the same performance is the same but uh with a design that i prefer and a vibration motor that actually notifies me more often but yeah overall this phone is good it delivers if you want a little bit of a more in-depth look at the one ui 4.1 software and the fact that this phone at least this lineup with the s22 for samsung seems to be basically the default android experience more so than google's pixel ever could be definitely watch my s22 review i'll leave a like button if you want to watch that real quick but that's been basically it thanks for watching catch you guys later peace 
8,zhoTX0RRXPQ,The Galaxy S23 Ultra is Better Than You Think!,2023-02-11T00:01:15Z,"{'viewCount': '5734767', 'likeCount': '179617', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '9751'}","(upbeat techno music) - Matte black glass, aluminum
rails, massive specs, quad cameras, a hidden stylus, oh wait, wait, hang on a sec. Yeah, no, that was the wrong phone, sorry. Let's start that over. (upbeat techno music) Matte black glass, aluminum rails, massive specs, quad
cameras, a hidden stylus. You get the plan. (upbeat techno music continues) Hey, what's up, MKBHD here, and this is the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. So, when this first came
out, when it got revealed, it was the easiest thing to do to just write it off as
an incremental upgrade, because I mean, look at it. Aesthetically speaking, it's
basically the same phone. The side radii are squared off more, so it feels a bit better
in the hand, sure, much more boxy like the notes of the past. They're also slightly bigger
rings around the cameras, and it's Gorilla Glass Victus
2 instead of Victus Plus, but as far as size, industrial
design, button placement, ports, the layout, it's
basically the same phone. But there are two real
upgrades to this phone. Now keep in mind, this is
replacing the Galaxy S22 Ultra, which was already my best
big phone of the year from last year, great battery, great screen, great performance, all of it was rock solid across the board, so there's not a lot that I
would naturally want to change. But, there are two things, and they're two of arguably
the most important things you can actually change in a phone, the chip that runs it all and the cameras. So you might have heard
about the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. It's been a really good chip in the other phones that it's been in, excellent CPU and GPU performance and really efficient which
touches battery life. Now, this phone, actually
the whole S23 lineup, has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy, a customized version of the chip, specifically for these Samsung phones. So if you watched the last video about how Apple's taking back the iPhone, then you know already that optimization and customization for parts inside phones is a good thing, generally. But the only thing that we've really seen that is customized for
this chip for Galaxy is a slightly higher max clock
speed on the performance core and slightly higher
clock speed on the GPU. So to be exact, 3.36GHz instead of 3.2 on the performance core and
719MHz versus 680 on the GPU. So yeah, it does score
slightly better on benchmarks than the regular Snapdragon
8 Gen 2, and that's nice for a little extra headroom
for high performance stuff, light gaming and for future-proofing, but that's not the whole story. There's two main things that matter here, one is efficiency gains. So, obviously performance is awesome, but because efficiency is better, these phones get some
serious battery life gains that we'll talk in a second. But also too, is bye-bye Exynos, because they're not making an
Exynos version of this phone as far as I can tell anywhere else. They're shipping every S23
Ultra with a Qualcomm chip, so everyone gets the efficiency and performance gains
from the Qualcomm version. So lemme tell you, the
battery life on this phone is actually, it's been incredible, like it's really, really good. So it's the 5,000 million power cell again shouldn't be a surprise,
but with this huge screen, I guess it kind of is actually a surprise. I had a two-day period at 120Hz but 1080P, where the only time I charged it was on the wireless charger in my car on the way to and from the studio for like the 40 minutes
that that drive is. I didn't charge it overnight
or anything like that. Two full packed days of high brightness, high intensity, normal use for me, has something like eight and a
half hours of screen-on time. I'm in bed at like 11:00 PM
at the end of the second day streaming on YouTube live watching LeBron break Kareem's record, it's still got like 10%
left, it just won't die. So combine this excellent battery life with a pretty solid 45 watt charging that can go zero to 100 in an
hour, plus wireless charging, and you've got yourself a
battery monster, it's super good. I don't think enough people are talking about how much better the battery got. Maybe someone will do one of
those crazy long runtime demos versus the past phone, but
yeah, it's really good, probably better than you think. You kind of don't ever
need to switch to 1080P to save batteries, matter of fact, when you take it out of the box, immediately just go in
and switch it to 1440P, 'cause you spent 1200 bucks on this phone, and it lasts forever, treat yourself. Okay anyway, that's the chips,
that's what that enables, but there's also a new set of cameras, hardware and software across the board that also is better than you think. Now, the fundamentals are mostly the same, which is why this
probably gets written off so quickly a lot. The layout, the aesthetics,
the focal lengths, the arrangement, it's
all practically the same, but we have a new
200-megapixel primary camera with double the optical image
stabilization range as before. That's hugely important. And then new sensors
across the ultra wide, the 3X telephoto, and the
10X periscope cameras. This new primary sensor setup though, I know we keep saying
cameras are mostly software, and as far as the look
and style of the photos, it absolutely still
is, but the improvement to the stabilization is so important here. So when you go from a normal sensor to a super-high resolution
200-megapixel sensor, the fact is, in these
tiny smartphone cameras, the individual pixels are
so small that individually, they physically can't
bring in that much light. So the camera does this
thing called binning, where it combines the information from a bunch of adjacent pixels to form larger more accurate
pixels in your image. So you're not shooting
200 megapixels by default, it's actually binning 16 pixels into one, so you end up taking a 12.5 megapixel shot for normal photos, but each photo is theoretically more
accurate thanks to its makeup. And then like I said, the
stabilization performance on this new primary camera has doubled. (phone rattles) Still rattles a little bit,
but that means it'll correct up to three degrees of shake
now versus the 1.5 from before, so here's an example of what's happening. If you get a lens with really good optical
image stabilization, (lens rattles) like this one, that means it can
correct from the movement in your hand much more, which means you can hold the
camera stable for much longer, so it can leave the shutter open to collect more light and
still get a sharp photo. So, all of this is to say
Galaxy S23 Ultra photos, most of the time, in most lighting, look pretty similar to last year. So if that's all you're looking at, just normal side by sides,
this is mostly gonna come down to the different software tuning, and there's a little bit more
dynamic range than last year, but yeah, still top of the line while mostly avoiding looking to HDR-y. Photos are typically pretty
warm from these Samsung phones, and they have a slightly punchier, more contrasty look than before, still very much up the Samsung alley of colorful and saturated,
but it's an aesthetic that I can get behind, I really like. But, on top of that,
having this new sensor and optical stabilization means one, you can shoot literally
200-megapixel photos now if you really want to. Now, this does accomplish
the intended purpose of capturing much more of the finer detail in things like landscapes, so if you plan on zooming
in on the shot later, or if you're one of the
three people on earth who will actually print
a smartphone photo, this should work, but
you should also be aware that it's only really able to give you these types of
results in excellent lighting where a ton of light is hitting every individual little pixel. Anything short of that, and you're gonna get a
lot of noise really quick. And there's also a
really solid shutter lag as it turns out these massive
40, 50 megabyte files, granted this mode is mostly
for things sitting still, like a landscape or a photo
shoot but worth noting. I think the better compromise is you actually also
get a 50-megapixel mode, which kicks out still very detailed images that hang right with the iPhone's
48-megapixel ProRAW shots in a variety of light, but now
the files are five megabytes, and there's a lot of less shutter lag. But there's still that improved detail over the normal binge shots
and not as much noise. It's all about flexibility. The standard mode is gonna be the best for most shots most of the time, but you can always turn
it up if you want to, and that's very much the
same thing with the zoom. You see all the cameras on the back. Any phone with two
different telephoto cameras is gonna have the biggest
range of good zoom performance. On this phone, anything past 10X is where it really shines
compared to others. And you might have even
seen my recent clip of taking a photo of
the full moon recently, which seems to blow people's
minds every time they see it. Wow, but you also can't
forget about video too. This is improved video across the board with better processing, the new sensors, and the much better stabilization,
thanks to the better OIS. So this might be the
best super steady mode I've ever seen in smartphone video, and the beauty of it being
from optical stabilization is it works great in
a variety of lighting, unlike some electronic
image stabilization, which relies on having a ton of light. And on top of all of that, the 8K video on this
smartphone is very usable. There are previous phones
that have had 8K video, it's not the first, but I remember when they
first got that capability, they'd always be at like 24 FPS, 'cause that's the most
that they could churn out, which is not the right frame
rate, so 8K/30 really good. And if you put it
side-by-side with the 4K, you can actually see
the sharpness difference if you really punch in. If you want a sample of this, the latest Auto Focus
video I shot in my car is in 8K from this phone, and you can actually go watch
it 8K on YouTube right now from the link below, hit that
like button if you want to. Oh yeah, and also, don't forget about the better selfies too. There's a new 12 megapixel selfie camera in all these S23 phones. And while that number is lower on paper than the 40 megapixel selfie camera that came before it, it's better. It's just better, rock solid proof that the megapixels don't matter. This selfie camera, with the
better software processing, is very sharp, detailed, has nice color, doesn't flare too much, and
also has a decently wide angle. It's not ultra-wide but not bad. So across the board, this is significant, an extensive improvement to the camera, especially the primary camera. That feels overlooked to me when people have been reviewing the phone. The one thing I still will complain about is there is still shutter lag, which is different from
slow shutter speed. So the time gap between
hitting the shutter button and actually capturing the
photo, it's still real, and it can still be kind of annoying, even if you capture a crisp
photo of the wrong moment. So, like I said, it's more pronounced when you take the ultra
high resolution 50-megapixel or 200-megapixel photos. You can't exactly do those in rapid fire. But if the question is, ""Did they make a meaningful improvement ""to last year's phone to end up here?"" I would say between the new chip and the better overall performance, and much better efficiency, which gets you huge
battery life improvement, and the new cameras
with the better sensors, better processing, but also
much better stabilization, I would say yes, not upgrade
from last year's phone, yes, but they've actually
made a real improvement. And then, I don't really need
to say too much about the rest because it's the same as before, which, in the case of the
best big phone of last year, is kind of a good thing. All the other things that
made this the best big phone are still here, and they're
not minor things either. I haven't even talked
about the A+ display, 1440P, 120Hz LTPO, 1,750
nits peak brightness, it's still awesome,
still has great speakers, still has very reliable software with a pretty good track record now of delivering software updates in a timely fashion for a while. The base storage has
also actually jumped up from 128 to 256 gigs, and it's
faster UFS 4.0 storage now. It still has the best stylus
in a smartphone in the world, which might mean a lot more
to you than it does to me, but, honestly, if I ever use it, it's nice knowing I can at any time mark up a screenshot or sign a PDF. And the list goes on, great haptic motor, nice clicky buttons, it's all still here. This thing sets the standard pretty high. My analogy that I was making is that it feels like the
portion 9/11 of smartphones. If you're gonna charge
1200 bucks for a phone, it better set high marks all
the way across the board, but it does, and it's pretty underrated, kind of boring, but it does. Now, if you want the S23 Ultra to look as improved as it actually is, I would recommend a skin from
channel sponsored, dbrand, maybe something like this Damascus skin, which adds a lot of character, where it would ordinarily be pretty blank. My favorite one is the Triple Black. It is actually included for free when you pick up any of
the holographic colorways, so you can check 'em
out at the link below. I say this phone is boring, and I think maybe understated
is the better word. Are there gonna be other
phones that come out this year that do one up this phone in
certain single categories? Yeah, 100%, there's probably gonna be a phone with 120X zoom. There's probably gonna be a
phone with crazy fast charging. This is only 45 watt charging.
Do I wish this was better? A little bit, sometimes. Is there gonna be a phone probably with a much bigger, better,
faster fingerprint reader? (soft bright music)
Yeah, probably. But as far as just nailing all
the marks across the board, yeah, this does it. Just as far as overall package, Samsung's software is settled,
the screen is sublime, it's still the sickest stylus, and it's snaps significantly
smoother shots, sick. Thanks for watching, catch you
guys in the next one, peace. (bright music continues) "

and this is not the first iPhone 5s review and it probably won't be the last but sometimes when you use the device for a while longer than the typical review period for tech reviewers you get a little bit of a better sense of what you like the device for and what you don't like it for and just a little tidbits and quirks about it and overall a general idea of how well you like to use it and that's exactly what this video is about this is an iPhone 5s review from the perspective of a person who uses a lot of Google services I've done videos about iOS before this is my first iPhone review believe it or not this took me like seven iPhones to actually do a review of it but without any further ado let's get right on into this so this is the iPhone 5s in Space Gray it comes in three colors but this is the one I personally thought was my favorite it's just as familiar as the rest of the iPhones out there it's running iOS 7 it has that familiar array of icons like every other iPhone and it's just as small in fact let me start by saying that yes I'm aware that the iPhone looks very small in my hands that's because it is small in my hands the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is a phone I've carried for a while now and it feels pretty natural for me to hold but it's a bigger than average phone for most people and it has a 5.7 inch display but to me it doesn't feel all that extreme but a smaller more common option that you'll probably see more frequently is the samsung galaxy s4 this is a pretty popular phone and it has a 5-inch display and has that same general look to it as a Galaxy Note 3 but it takes up less space and involves reaching to the corners of it less but even smaller than that is the Moto X this is one of my favorite devices right now and it's very compact it stuffs a 4.7 inch display into a body that's not that much bigger than the iPhone so I can grip the whole thing but even this phone starts to look big when you compare it to the iPhone 5s this phone has a 4-inch display so it's easily the smallest of the displays on any flagship by any company right now but it's also one of the most compact mobile devices period which is something that Apple's really proud of in this phone and I don't blame them the device is really light really easy to hold and people can reach all four corners of the display with one hand although I think people could do that on a four and a half inch display too but this is also one of the most fragile feeling phones out there it's not actually fragile it's really extremely well built it's made out of premium materials like the HTC one it's got metal in there it's very tightly put together there's no creaking or any twisting or anything like that but the lack of any curves plus the glass on the back like the Nexus 4 make it feel like I better not drop this device like if I drop it from a few inches up it feels like it's very delicate and vulnerable to scratches like I should be putting a case on it or something now there are a couple of things about the battery in this device it's like we said a 1570 milliamp hour battery and that measurement is pretty small in fact this entire iPhone is about the same size as a galaxy note 3 battery which is over 3000 milliamp hours so with this having half the battery sizes and Note 3 has its pros and has its cons one of the important pros is that it charges very quickly I'd like to say it charges lightning fast but the cons are immediately that the battery doesn't last quite as long as any other smartphone out there with a larger battery now standby times are excellent on the iPhone I could go to sleep with an iPhone at 100% battery not charge it and it would wake up with 97% battery that's pretty good an Android device with a similar sized battery might be at 80% when you wake up so that's pretty good that iOS takes good advantage of what it thinks you should be closing in the background when you're sleeping but it doesn't have the best battery life during actual use in fact it's not even quite as good as the iPhone 5 I'd say maybe 5 percent worse than the iPhone 5 but it's it's about the same battery life as you'd expect from an iPhone so if you're coming from a previous generation iPhone you won't find too many surprises here with the battery life everything else about the hardware though is very well crafted we saw this in the iPhone 5 - it's solid aluminum on the sides in the back it has awesome buttons that are precisely crafted so that they don't wobble at all which is nice plus they have the laser etchings to indicate volume up and down the chamfered edges are angled ever so slightly inwards the headphone jack and the Lightning port are on the bottom with the precisely milled speaker grille holes I mean I don't think it's it's it's just about how all this is in such a small package that makes it a little difficult to appreciate which is why I think HTC one still feels just as good in the hand now the speakers on the bottom of the iPhone are one of the more interesting parts of it I expected them to be really good but check this out there are two speaker grilles at the bottom of the iPhone that looks great looks like stereo speakers but it's actually just a single driver on the right-hand side sort of echoes over to the left-hand side so if you cover up the left-hand side you will hear no change in the sound if you cover up the right-hand side where the driver is you can completely mute the speakers so you have to be sure not to do that by accident I'll give you a sample of a sound completely muted well anyway like we've said the iPhone has obviously familiar Hardware on the outside but what about the inside because that's where the main change came from between the 5 and the 5s now if you thought the Moto X was a consumer-oriented device that didn't care about specs and targeted the average consumer wait till you see the spec sheet of the iPhone 5s it has on paper the same specs as literally not even exaggerating a flagship from 2011 meet the Samsung Galaxy s2 release date April 2011 inside it had a dual-core 1.2 gigahertz chip 1 gigabyte of RAM 32 gigabytes of storage an 8 megapixel camera and a 1650 milliamp hour battery now meet the iPhone 5s release date a couple weeks ago it has a dual-core 1.3 gigahertz chip 1 gigabyte of RAM 32 gigabytes of storage and 8 megapixel camera and a 1570 milliamp hour battery so this is where Apple does its absolute best to make sure specs don't matter nearly as much as I used to they control the entire experience from the hardware to the software and there's a lot of optimization going on and in the end performance throughout iOS 7 is pretty snappy it performs on par with just about every other flagship today that has an 8 core chip and double the RAM and 20 megapixel cameras and iOS as we know never really required all that much resources to run smoothly and multitask well and not eat through battery life like a hungry wolf through steak so it's not really surprised that the iPhone 5s is quite fast especially when compared to older iPhones but how is IO s7 well for me actually like the look of ios7 at least a lot of it but its functionality is still exactly the same as iOS 6 it's essentially a layer of gloss over the top a visual overhaul if you will the motto here is you'll probably like it or learn to like it but if you don't too bad because you just can't change things you still can't customize a lot of the things that I'm used to being able to customize out-of-the-box on something like an Android phone in iOS 7 you'll probably like most of the new icons but if you don't like one or two or several too bad you might like the new keyboard but if you don't too bad you might love the new stock lockscreen or the new dialer or all the new stock applications but if you don't too bad my biggest gripe with iOS 7 was actually the animation so every time I unlock the iPhone 5s there was this new animation in iOS 7 that takes a solid half a second before it lets me do anything on the home screen and I don't like that at all and that's too bad so now anytime I want to unlock the phone and I already know I want to go to the second page of apps I have to wait for the animation to finish before I can do anything because wall is animating its unresponsive on the touchscreen still bugs me to this day I wish I could change the animation speed just speed it up a little bit there's also a lot of weird little bits of fragmentation like with the keyboard for example where if the app you're using isn't updated for iOS 7 it doesn't get to use Apple's new keyboard goodies the old iOS 7 looking keyboard which creates a bit of visual inconsistency and that will I guess be a bit of a mess until app developers get on the case and update their apps for the new OS but overall yeah I like the look of a lot of iOS 7 I think it's quite nice in a lot of areas that aren't the icons on the home screen but the functionality I still have problems with and those still remain and that's too bad now outside of this of course iOS is still a great choice for a lot of people and that obviously won't change I mean 10 million people bought this phone the first weekend it was available so it's clear that people love it and want it as a Google service user with stuff you know like Gmail Google Drive Google Calendar tasks etc you can get most of the core stuff you need and get away with it from the app store so the situation is really not that bad at all and then there are of course the few fringe benefits of the iPhone like touch ID for example which is the name for the fancy fingerprint sensor in the home button of the iPhone lets you unlock your phone or vente Kate your iTunes purchases and you can register up to ten fingers of course people have also found great ways to register things other than fingers like their toes their pets toes and even other body parts but uh it's a cool feature it works pretty well pretty accurately most of the time just note that every time you restart your phone you'll have to re-enter your whole iTunes password before using touch ID and app store again another thing that's great about the iPhone is the camera experience the camera experience in my opinion is made up of two different parts it's the quality and the control and there's a little bit of the scale I'd say between one and ten for quality and between one and ten for control a lot of devices that have ten out of ten for quality like the Lumia 1020 for example you can't just give it to a random person on the street and ask them to take a great photo with it they'll probably have a little bit of difficulty but if you get a really really easy to use camera chances are it's not going to take great photos so the iPhone strikes a nice balance because on the scale of one to ten for quality it's around an eight and on the scale of one to ten for control it's pretty simple but it's an easy to use app so that's another eight out of ten and I think that is what makes it a very likable camera you can just open it with a swipe up from the shortcut in the corner and immediately begin to take pictures so characterize the camera on the back of the iPhone 5s as a very fast camera and a bunch of different ways fast number one because it's very fast to take photos and to process shots that's number two because taking HDR's is very quick so you don't have to have it necessarily still subject fast number three because the aperture itself is very fast is wide open I believe it's F 2.0 or 2.2 which can be a little bit softer than the iPhone five but still is plenty fast and great for low-light and again fast because of the video modes in here you can take really really fast 120 frames per second video and then slow it down to 30 frames per second to get this awesome smooth slow-motion effect so this is a very fast camera what I most enjoyed about shooting with the 5s is camera though was the low-light capabilities the thing can essentially see in the dark where a lot of the other camera phones I've used fall short but you can see all the test shots that I took in the full imager link in the description right below that like button where I'll you see you know low-light shots and regular light shots and usually get the photos it takes are really pretty solid the colors were very accurate like extremely colorful and created the detail was pretty much all there it was only a little bit softer than the iPhone 5 because of the wider aperture but overall the shots you get out of this thing are very good overall though in terms of the quality of photos and videos you get and the control you have over them this is up there in some of the best smartphones you can get to take photos with so yeah using the iPhone 5s is just as you would expect you get great performance smooth animations throughout you get that super compact form factor and excellent build quality and design and material choices and you get the usual quirks with a relatively new operating system but those will either iron out or we will get used to them you get that future-proof ness with the new 64-bit architecture apple's new chip and apple having control over the whole OS and ecosystem and have a very reliable device that almost always works exactly as you'd expect it to even if you don't like the way it does something you can be confident that it'll do it that way every single time until you get used to it it's a very familiar device for a lot of people and probably isn't worth rushing to upgrade to if you're coming from an iPhone 5 but from any other older iPhone it's a great choice for all it's worth so at the end of the day there are some things that are really liked about the iPhone and some things that I really don't like obviously about the iPhone that a lot of other people will probably agree with the display is one of the most polarizing things to me I love the quality of the display I just wish it was bigger and there are a lot of things that I like about the build it's a beautifully crafted device it's just a little bit too small and feels a little bit fragile even though is in fact really sturdy no creaking or bending at all so there are some polarizing things about it at the end of the day though I'm not a big is user if you want to see a full dedicated iOS review or sort of a video on just me and iOS who free to leave a comment below or a thumbs up if you want to see something like that but either way this has been it this is the iPhone 5s in space grey thank you for watching the review and I'll talk to you guys in the next video you 
10,61TAqY03xwk,Apple iPhone 6 Review!,2014-10-09T08:04:50Z,"{'viewCount': '7700717', 'likeCount': '82104', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '9914'}",[Music] hey what is up guys mkbhd here and this is apple's new flagship phone for the next year the iphone 6. so there's a new design this year for apple's flagship and of course the theme here is thin and light this phone is 6.9 millimeters thin and it's all one piece of aluminum rounded off at the corners so instead of having the squared off edges like the last iphone apple's rounded off the sides the phone feels a lot more like the htc one m8 now and this has two effects the first is that it gives the whole body this seamless feel if you start your finger on the screen and drag it all the way around to the back of the phone you won't encounter any seams it's just one smooth surface but two is that since it's so smooth it's actually a bit slippery to hold plus it's a little bigger and it's so light that my confidence actually holding and manipulating this phone in the hand is dropping every time but part of me wants to put a case on it but you guys know how i feel about cases so a high quality skin will suit me just fine and of course dbrand has a couple of badass skins for the iphone 6 to help out this grip ability so i'll leave links to those right below the like button if you want to check those out highly recommended but the rest of the build of this phone is definitely awesome it's a bit bigger than the last iphone but i think it's a much better size now and you only take a few minutes to get used to it before you look back at the iphone 5s and it starts to look like a toy uh it's obviously a bit bigger than other phones with a 4.7 inch display since this one has a big old chin for the home button and a big forehead to match but what's more striking than its size is i think the thinness again 6.9 millimeters that is crazy thin almost feels too thin and light to be a working phone it feels almost the same weight as the dummy phone uh it's so thin in fact the camera lens on the back protrudes out a bit now this turns out to be not a huge deal since it's coated in sapphire anyway and it just rocks a bit when it's placed on a flat surface but that's minor so this is the first iphone to move the power button from the top to the side of the phone and that's good that's what other bigger phones have been doing for years and that's much easier to reach and also it has a physical mute switch and i think that's a nice touch most phones don't do this yet but it sometimes got switched off in my pocket every once in a while but i like the physical mute button so i have a few mixed feelings overall about the build of the phone since it's so razor thin but it's definitely built well it shouldn't bend in your pocket or anything actually i think the worst quirk about the hardware is the speaker on the bottom it's a pretty loud speaker i mean it's got decent mids and highs and it's a little bit tinny but the thing is it's a small downward facing driver so it's really easy to accidentally block it when you're holding the phone watching a video or playing a game now i know the elephant in the room right now is the iphone 6 plus which is the companion 5.5 inch iphone that apple released alongside the iphone 6 a couple of weeks ago and basically my opinion on that is this i'm going to review it separately in a completely different video and that's upcoming but if you're trying to decide between the six and the six plus consider this all of the factors that make the iphone 6 a little bit slippery and a little bit difficult to hold on the hand are amplified on the iphone 6 plus it's an even bigger phone in every single way and it's still rounded on the edges so it's even more difficult to grip the easiest way to see this is to go into an apple store and hold one but trust me the 6 plus is huge so really besides improved internals the main physical advantage to this iphone 6 over an older iphone is the size it's a bigger screen and has all the advantages that naturally come with having that bigger screen so bigger icons bigger ui bigger text bigger web browsing bigger gaming bigger video watching bigger keyboard but what's funny is it stops there so the iphone 6 has a 4.7 inch 1334 by 750 ips display with awesome colors and great brightness and incredible viewing angles and a pretty high pixel density 326 ppi makes it the same as the iphone 5 and 5s and ios 8 is trained to take advantage of every inch of this display by basically scaling everything up from the iphone 5s but like i said there aren't really any extra features in ios to take advantage of the larger display so there aren't no multitasking features or anything extra there is apple's interestingly implemented reachability which is basically to make one-handed use easier so you can double touch the home button to move the ui halfway down the display so you can interact with the top half of stuff i sometimes use this to reach those top corner buttons and apps or pull down the notification bar when i'm feeling lazy but yeah that's about it as far as apple's extra features for a big screen go again it's a great display i just i guess i wish they just did more to take advantage of it maybe show more apps in the multitasking menu make touch targets bigger in first party apps things like that they don't have to force anything but i just wish they did a bit more with all those extra pixels but the rest of ios 8 is very familiar to anyone who's ever used an iphone or an ipad before i really don't have to explain that you have some improvements to the notification area so now you can add widgets just to the notification area that stay there and permanently show information so you can get more apps from the app store to fill up this panel with different widgets that show info and you can you can kind of mess around with these and get shortcuts and real-time stats and info and stuff and that's nice but you can only have them like i said in this today section of your notification panel but overall you have a nice layer of gloss over the top of a very familiar user interface it's prettied up with this gloss and reflections all over the place i still like ios a lot even though it's a bit restricted in terms of where i can share to and how i can get into google services but it seems like every new version there's a flash of something that makes the os a little more appealing speaking of flash uh there's a highlight of the new iphone and that is the camera on the back actually the camera is always a highlight of the new iphone but that doesn't mean we should take it for granted the iphone 6 has a great camera one of the best and one of the fastest in any smartphone i think that's a key word here towards making the camera so great it's extremely fast so user interface is fast taking a picture is really really fast it can take high frame rate fast video at 30 60 or 720p even 240 frames per second it has fast autofocus with this new technology it has a fast wide open aperture glass for great low light performance uh now it's still an eight megapixel camera but on that one third inch sensor it's kind of like a hybrid between htc's massive ultra pixels and samsung's cramming as many pixels as possible mentalities maybe this is the middle ground that we were asking htc to take all along all the photos it takes are very clean the camera tends to have a bias towards a faster shutter speed kind of like the oneplus one to avoid blurriness so it's willing to crank up the iso and just trust its top notch image processing to clean things up and that's really where it's separated it has great image processing and this does a pretty good job of cleaning up noise which makes some crispy clean shots with excellent color the only downside of this camera i would say is the fact that it's only 8 megapixels which means no 4k video 4k is actually 8.3 megapixels so this 8 megapixel sensor means this iphone will not shoot 4k video until the next one so overall like i said before this whole phone is a very familiar phone a safe upgrade for previous iphone users for sure if you just straight up look at the numbers you'll see a 1.4 gigahertz dual core chip and one gig of ram but the thing performs like any other phone with a 2.5 gigahertz chip and three gigs of ram so you can thank apple's vertical integration and the awesome a8 chip for that so with the iphone 6 you're getting a great performer a great camera a great display and a great design all in a super thin package so with a super thin phone you also get a super thin battery so the iphone 6 is rocking a 810 milliamp hour battery on paper that's really small and you might consider that super small by other phone standards by android phone standards by other flagship standards by other 4.7 inch phone standards but apple has the advantage of at least it owns that a8 chip it has ios under control everything is optimized to give it the longest battery life possible so i would summarize by saying it has about 10 to 15 better battery life than the iphone 5s it's not amazingly great but it's not bad it has the advantage of having a really good standby time so if you don't use it a lot during the day or if you have a light usage day you'll probably make it throughout the day not having any problems you can go to sleep with 100 battery forget to charge it and wake up with 98 so that's great but on a heavy day if you're doing a lot of web browsing a lot of photo and video taking a lot of video watching a lot of gaming if you're doing a lot of stuff where the screen on time is high during that day you're probably not going to make it to the end of the day and you're going to have to go find a charger before the day is out this is not different from the iphone 5s this is just something that comes with having a small thin phone and apple's totally fine with making that sacrifice i just wish the phone was a little bit thicker so they could fit maybe a 2000 or 2100 milliamp hour battery and that would make the phone yes a little bigger but it would get rid of the camera protrusion and might make it a little bit easier to hold but that's all stuff i've said before but look there's one more thing ios isn't perfect there are hiccups sometimes there are bugs sometimes there was that 8.0.1 update that freaking bricked the phone but they quickly fixed that but this is the first time in a while that i've seen a significant lag in major developers getting their apps updated to ios 8 on this bigger iphone especially the 6 and the 6 plus apps that haven't been updated for this larger display look big and awkward and fuzzy and strange and i hope devs get on that to fix their apps and then and only then i will have basically nothing except the battery to complain about in the iphone 6. so solid phone apple so my overall final verdict uh obviously as a heavy google service user a google plus user youtube user gmail user google tasks google keep google calendar all these things ios 8 and iphones aren't my first choice obviously but my choice of iphone is also not the iphone 6 it's the iphone 6 plus and i'll be talking more about why the iphone 6 plus is my iphone of choice in that full review video but for right now the iphone 6 is a safe step forward it's a it's a definite upgrade from the last iphone but like i said not a mandatory upgrade so stay tuned for that six plus review video and many more forward videos to come thank you for watching this one and i'll talk to you guys in the next one peace 
11,0Ae0YwmgYTY,The iPhone 7 Plus Model!,2016-08-12T22:09:04Z,"{'viewCount': '1425745', 'likeCount': '29485', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '3363'}",hey what is up guys i'm kim Bhd here and I kind of already warned you but we can't leave all the hype for this year for just one phone so this is another I don't know if you've seen this already or if you haven't but this is the iPhone 7 plus model so obviously we're expecting an iPhone 7 to be announced and released probably around September of this year and we kind of already know all of the new software features because iOS 10 beta has been floating around and people have been using it for the past couple weeks I did a video showing all the new features at WWDC but what we don't have yet and what's going to be announced is a new hardware so there's been rumors of a new iphone 7 pro or an iPhone 7 plus along with an iPhone 7 whatever you want to call it this is more than just like a render from a computer of an image of what it might look like this is an actual dummy unit put together based on all the leaks and rumors of what the iPhone 7 plus is going to look like and feel like in the hand made of metal and everything so let's take a closer look at well you'll notice there's three main features that are visibly new about the iPhone 7 and 7 plus based on this body 1 the antenna lines to the headphone jack or lack thereof and 3 the dual cameras so the antenna lines are pretty much the only aesthetic or visual change between this year's iPhone and the new one we're about to get so this year's antenna vans go all the way across and around the top and the bottom this year it's looking like it's just the top in the bottom and nothing across the back looks cleaner to me I guess didn't really have a problem with the band's but this is fine I guess this might be one of those things where it's the only way you can tell someone has the new iPhone unless there's a new color which there might be number 2 is the headphone jack or the lack thereof you probably already saw this video earlier but yeah the rumors still point to Apple getting rid of the headphone jack in the next iPhone so this model has no such port what you do get though which is interesting is now 2 speaker grilles which I'm going to be optimistic and hope that that means stereo speakers like the iPads now it's very possible that this may just be another speaker grille for a single speaker but I'm going to be optimistic I'm hoping they use a space to put in another driver please give a stereo audio anyway last but not you can see the dual camera module on the back so all right at this point that's all we really know about it like we know that it'll have two cameras but we don't know what they will do or we don't know if they will be the same or different I made an entire video all about dual camera smartphones already so I'll link that below but there are some that already have one wide angle and one normal smartphone camera that you can switch between there are smartphones that have two of the same camera that combine the image to get more detail we don't know what Apple is doing with the iPhone 7 plus but we're pretty sure it will at least be rockin the dual camera setup you may have also noticed that this mock-up does not have the couple of smart connector pins that we have seen on some other mock-ups and this actually relates to the rumor that we may see an iphone 7 pro which will connect to some accessories like the iPad pro via those smart connector pins and then this which is just an iPhone 7 plus doesn't have the pins and then we can also assume a regular sized iPhone 7 also won't have those pins overall though pretty similar design to iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s that we already have you know same rounded shape same thickness same button placement you know same switches bezels the home button everything is super similar already about the overall design I'm gonna go out on a limb and say I'm hoping I'm just hoping that something that we haven't seen in any of the mock-ups or in any of the leaks is a new display on the front of the iPhone I feel like they could double the resolution of the display and I feel like they could also finally incorporate an OLED display in the iPhone 7 and 7 plus now that's obviously we won't be able to tell this from the mock-ups we can't tell this from the dummy units but I feel like it's about time we give the bigger iPhone a much nicer screen anyway that's pretty much it just a short video obviously not a whole ton that you can learn from the dummy units and mock-ups from the rumours we've already seen but it's just kind of neat to have the actual form factor in person and just see what it would look like if you were to hold it in the hand either way let me know what you guys would think if you're into this design new design of the iPhone 7 or if you would have liked some other features or something else let me know in the comments section right below that like button that's pretty much it thanks for watching I'll talk to you guys the next one peace you 
12,ld5H2L4j6LE,iPhone 8 Review: Skip this Great Phone!,2017-09-30T02:37:31Z,"{'viewCount': '5241434', 'likeCount': '106906', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '8768'}",[Music] hey what is up guys mkbhd here and this is the iphone 8 review and yes i know iphone 10 is like right around the corner this is true but as of right now this is the newest and best iphone so here's the thing this is actually a really great phone in a lot of ways but it's going to tend to go under the radar and really the only reason i'm telling you to probably skip this is because of that iphone 10. it's just better but i'm going to try to review this phone in a vacuum as if we don't know that this is about to be one-upped so this is everything you need to know about iphone 8. so on the outside aesthetically it's very similar to iphone 7 of course same layout it's the same dimensions actually so old cases will work with it as well same camera bump same general look it just looks like an iphone again the one biggest difference besides the new colors is the glass on the back so this glass is a bit heavier a bit grippier actually than rounded metal and a bit more fingerprinty naturally but most of all it's more breakable than aluminum so that's something to note even if you are using the strongest glass ever apple it's glass the thin finish is really nice though as you'd expect everything on the back of the phone is underneath the glass so the apple logo is no longer a cutout in the metal it's behind the glass that iphone logo the text is behind the glass even the dual flash is under the glass so it's all smooth to the touch but the main reason they went with the glass is wireless charging so iphone 8 now supports qi enabled wireless charging through that glass so any of those wireless charging pads you see at starbucks or on those ikea tables or at a samsung user's bedside table the iphone can now use those too nice clearly not first but still nice it doesn't have to be first to be nice in fact it's really nice that the iphone is getting qi enabled wireless charging and not some proprietary standard because that now means we're gonna start seeing these qi wireless charging accessories everywhere that work with all of the phones that already support it i mean think about it if the iphone can make the apple watch an accessory the most popular watch in the world then seems like the iphone getting wireless charging should also be able to make that pretty popular too thanks apple and also if you're thinking what i'm thinking then yeah that's space gray iphone 8 is another fingerprint magnet for real uh reflections i can deal with that's just something that's on every glass phone fingerprints not so much they show up a lot more on the space gray but you can grab a dbrand skin to cover that up and it might actually look better with the matte black than the glossy space gray just throwing that out there so i'll link this one below so around the front the iphone 8 and 8 plus have mostly the same displays as before still ips still the same resolution and everything but they now support true tone which was something that was in ipads before essentially what it does is when you turn it on it adjusts the color temperature of the screen to match the lighting of whatever environment you're in so under certain lights it makes the display itself more yellow under other lights it's closer to blue all of it is to stay visually consistent to the eye it's technically less accurate but also tends to look better so i'm cool with it i leave it on as long as i'm not editing or like making something where accurate color really matters really i'm just sad there's no pro motion display no oled display no resolution bump you know still 1080p in 2017 seriously you could say i'm even disappointed with the display or lack of a display upgrade but it is what it is it's still i guess the best ips display in any smartphone also the speakers are 25 louder on iphone 8. honestly i don't hear much of a loudness difference it sounds to me more like a clarity difference these just sound better but yeah everything else new about the iphone 8 is on the inside and that would be with the cameras and the specs so when we originally got this announcement i thought this would be some pretty minor upgrades you know slightly new camera bump we see that every year and of course the new specs the a11 bionic chip it'll be faster but we may or may not notice that but these two things have actually really impressed me and turns out they've actually enabled some things that literally no other smartphone right now can do the a11 bionic chip is ridiculously powerful it is the fastest chip in any smartphone right now and it's not close the benchmarks show it the everyday use shows it it's more powerful and more efficient than any other chipset which is awesome in a phone so because of this number one battery life has actually improved significantly because of this efficiency essentially it's not working as hard and is smarter about what cores fire up when so iphone 8 and 8 plus have really good battery life in fact i'd say with the five plus hours of consistent screen on time i'm getting and a full day of heavy use ending with 20 seems like this is back to being the battery life king of the hill with the 8 plus and then everyday performance is excellent i mean ios 11 is already pretty smooth on a brand new phone anyway but i made a separate video all about its best features essentially though it means that this is much more future-proof a super high-powered chip like this should ideally keep the phone running smooth for years to come as apps and services get more intensive a prime example of that is all the new augmented reality applications this stuff takes a lot more processing power to run smoothly but like this sky guide really cool stuff like this has started to pop up for ios that tracks really smoothly shows a ton of information over your real life and renders in high quality color me impressed and then the super powerful chip enables some seriously impressive video features in the camera that again you really don't see many other places 4k 60 frames per second video and 1080p 240 frames per second slo-mo these are things you barely find in any other smartphone let alone an actual dedicated video camera right now i mean the new gopro does it my red camera does it but that's about it not much else and it's not just that the frame rates are high but the quality is really good too 11 bionic has room for much better dedicated image processing and it's excellent with things like noise reduction and high dynamic range and contrast and sharpness and detail and all of that now they are also technically new 12 megapixel sensors so i give them credit for that too it's new hardware new cameras for both the 8 and 8 plus also put a new secondary telephoto camera for the plus but wow i did not think they would be this good and yes it did get the highest ever rating from dxomark but i wouldn't put too much stock in the comparative numbers there just know that photo quality has taken a noticeable step up and even though the next google pixel is right around the corner and iphone 10 with slightly better glass is also incoming the photos i've gotten from this phone have pretty much cemented it in the top five smartphone cameras of this year it's that good right off the bat if you're into photography iphone 8 will not disappoint there's also the new improvements to portrait mode on the 8 plus so you can now take these portrait photos and adjust the portrait lighting effects during or after you've taken the photo and they try to mimic different types of contrasty lighting if you're trying to take that to the next level they're a little bit interesting uh the first few actually do a pretty decent job i think they're likely to get better with software updates in the future the last two though with the super dramatic stage light they kind of look a bit more like cartoon cutouts if you don't get them perfect so i would advise to i guess use them sparingly unless you want to be the first one with that stage light profile picture so yeah the camera is really good the performance is really good the battery life is on point i mean there's not a whole lot to complain about with these new phones except the fact that the design is so brutally outdated for 2017 in this price point in fact i saved all my complaints here for the end of the video ready it gets a little bit too warm when wireless charging i mean other phones i've used in the past couple years also get warm to varying degrees when they're on the charging pad iphone is definitely near the high end of that spectrum and wireless charging isn't perfect you need contact with that pad and as soon as you want to use the phone and pick it up it stops charging unless you pick up the phone and the charger every time but that's not unique to the iphone it doesn't come with the usbc fast charger in the box iphone 8 is capable of some really fast charging speeds with usbc but it won't get those speeds with the out of the box wall adapter you need to pay extra for that that's pretty lame i wish they used this entire huge bezel up at the front to put a real front-facing speaker even if it's only one side of the phone this earpiece really isn't that loud it's not adding much it will be better than nothing right now it's kind of weak and for this price of course i wish the display was oled i wish it was a higher resolution too i wish it was a bit brighter but really i wish it got a lot closer to the edges i'm overall just kind of bored with the screen and the design at this point and of course it still does not have a headphone jack yeah obviously i can't pretend i think that's coming back but i have to say it it doesn't have one so that's iphone 8. is it boring heck yeah you could say it's boring especially on the outside we've seen it before but for that a11 bionic chip for us nerds that really is something else i mean i'll say it again it really is actually a great phone but the only reason i'm telling you to skip this one is because we know iphone 10 is coming out in like a month i'd say the only reason to get this phone over the upcoming iphone 10 is if you really want to save the 200 bucks which a lot of people will or if you just absolutely have to have a smaller device that iphone 10 does have a pretty big display so this is actually smaller than that or if you just really really need to keep touch id for some reason but really a big part of why apple made this phone and sort of fit it in with the iphone 10 and the other prices so they could offer a phone and iphone at each of these major buying prices all of these are for sale on apple.com right now and that's a nice even spread it's a gradient of prices to offer an iphone for any budget so the timing is kind of weird with iphone 8 coming out right before iphone 10 and it's probably very tempting to pick up iphone 8 but you already heard what it said so to spring all this money right now for what's about to be the second best iphone i mean it's not a bad phone but when the better one's clearly around the corner seems like it's an obvious choice to recommend that one feels weird to tell you to skip a great phone but there you have it but hey even if you do go with iphone 8 you probably won't be disappointed there you have it thank you for watching talk to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
13,9Ca8zWJOlFQ,Apple iPhone X Review: The Best Yet!,2017-11-15T02:17:29Z,"{'viewCount': '8097955', 'likeCount': '175549', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '15680'}",come on hey what's up guys mkbhd here and this is iphone 10 and it's my favorite iphone ever by far and there's no doubt that in the history of iphones this thing is iconic it's more modern it finally feels like a new iphone that's a big part of why i like it so much but that's also the source for a few sore spots there's a learning curve to this phone unlike any other iphone you see every other iphone ever has just been home button rectangle screen rounded corners pretty much the same thing you know what you're getting yourself into you know exactly how to use it and if there's maybe one big new feature every year it takes you two seconds to learn it and you're good iphone 10 is different with this phone there's maybe three or four big fundamental changes to the way you use the phone now it's very clearly still an iphone you still mostly know how to use it but there's a couple things that are different that you'll have to get used to so on the outside it's the shape we're used to the rectangle with rounded corners but this is the first time the display itself actually has curved corners and it's pushed right up to the edges of the phone or at least closer than they've ever been the commercials make it seem a little more dramatic than it actually is but hey it's 2017 phones have small bezels that's just the way they are now so in that way the iphone catches up and it pushes everything to the corners and keeps all the front-facing sensors in the notch that forsaken notch at the top it's actually not that big of a deal but we'll get into that soon just holding the phone though it feels great i think it's an awesome size but if there were a bigger iphone 10 plus i would totally get that right now despite the larger display the 10 is definitely closer to feeling like an iphone 8 than an 8 plus it still feels like a smaller phone compared to the others i've used and also thanks to the stainless steel sides it's definitely slippery and it's definitely going to slide out of your pocket at least once it happens to the best of them and it's crazy the silver it's so shiny and honestly we all know your phone is never going to look as good as it does fresh out the box unlike the more matte finish of the previous iphone i'm not convinced this super shiny finish on the iphone's rails is going to last like this we've seen this before in other products it definitely gets chipped and scratched you probably already know i usually go for a matte black skin here which not gonna lie still looks pretty good but dbrand's got something new for the 10 the grip so like the name implies this thing is supposed to be the best way to grip your phone look for a full review of this bumper later this month but i'll leave a link below if you want to check this one out a lot of people were asking about it when i showed it in my instagram story but overall it's a pretty complete hardware package as you'd expect from a thousand dollar smartphone you know it's the speakers even though they aren't front facing are still pretty good it's water resistant which gives you some nice peace of mind it has wireless charging there's no headphone jack welcome to 2017 but overall it's well considered and well put together uh is it now officially the most breakable iphone ever thanks to having glass on the back yes yes the one part of the hardware of this phone i actually really don't like is the camera bump but not just for the usual reason like rocking on a table i've just kind of accepted that at this point but because of the new orientation a couple times i've noticed it's easy to accidentally get your finger in the photo or video you're taking just because it's all up in the corner it might take a couple days to get used to that and stop getting your finger in the corner of your shots but what's really become the signature feature of the iphone 10 is around the front and it is that notch up at the top of the display and there are two camps with this number one is i hate it it's ugly i wish it wasn't there and number two is i actually don't notice it anymore and just like with the essential phone i tend to fall more in camp number two when you want to make a 2017 phone and you want to shrink the bezels you still have to put all the front-facing sensors all of the cameras and the ir blaster and the depth sensor you have to put that somewhere in 2017 some manufacturers keep a smaller traditional bezel to house it some try to go no top bezel and put everything in the chin some try to minimize all the bezels and use a sort of a cut out notch apple has decided to go with a notch and i don't mind it in fact i literally don't even think about it anymore in everyday use now obviously when you're focusing on it here as i'm talking about it and highlighting it on video it's really obvious you know the unibrow at the top it kind of just becomes a part of this iphone 10s character but you're never really looking at it during normal use like flipping through apps scrolling through twitter instagram whatever it disappears pretty quick now not everybody feels this way clearly like i've seen all the clever like hiding the notch stuff all the apps and the wallpapers and that i get that uh but because this is apple and because they're stubborn and will never admit that any of their solutions are anything other than perfect they've come up with the opposite solution which is embrace the notch so in all their software and all the software they'll promote is apps that wrap right around that notch and fill up the whole display that's what an optimized iphone 10 app looks like and since this is a taller aspect ratio apps will have to get updated to do this developers will have to get on their horse and actually put in the work and update their apps to get them to fill up the display like this and to be fair most of the big name apps are already upgrading and embracing the notch like apple wants but there are still plenty that haven't updated yet and they'll be obvious when you see them because they'll have these big bezels about the top and the bottom kind of like you're using them on an iphone 8 again so slowly over the next couple of weeks and months all the apps you're using will get updated to embrace that notch whether you like it or not it just takes some time probably the biggest change developers have had to make to their apps for a new iphone since the beginning so for the record the only time i really think about that notch is when i'm watching videos yes it gets kind of awkward here because when you're watching videos full screen the notch will cut off some of the display some of what you're trying to watch so if you want to avoid that you can actually double tap and it'll bring in the video you're watching on this oled display now you have some more bezels but at this point now the video you're watching is so small you might as well not be watching it on a bigger screen it feels like the same size as the iphone 8. so this whole thing is the main reason why i would actually want a plus sized iphone 10. anyway as for the rest of the display it's great apple calls it a super retina display i just call it their first oled in a smartphone ever finally and it's it's pretty awesome it's a 5.8 inch panel high pixel density it supports the p3 color gamut hdr it has true tone it doesn't get as bright and saturated as samsung's like note 8 and s8 displays but it is still bright enough not too cartoonish with the colors has a small blue shift when you tilt it off axis but so do many other oleds to varying degrees and it still has 3d touch although i pretty much stopped using that completely except for lock screen controls that i wish i could change so the screen is awesome and it's a big part of why this phone looks so good from so many angles so uh good job samsung now of course when you go to a full screen display like this you lose the home button so that's why iphone 10 replaces that home button with a whole bunch of gestures this is the biggest learning curve of any iphone ever but it's still not that bad you swipe up from that bar at the bottom of the screen at any time to go home now anytime you see that bar it represents the home and whatever app you're in will close itself just like any other iphone hitting the home button swipe down from the top for notifications but now swipe from the right corner for your control center and then for multitasking again you have no home button so you swipe halfway up and then over to get through your recent apps that'll get you to that same card style carousel as before but overall once you get hang of this system once you get used to all this swiping which took me a couple days it felt pretty natural i actually started trying to swipe up on other phones which shows you how weird how much i got used to that the one that took me the longest was multitasking because i started off thinking you had to swipe up then wait and then the cards show up but that always felt so slow but what you really have to do to get this to work is you swipe up and over and that gets you to the cards way faster so that's a pro tip for anyone who is still swiping up halfway and waiting for the cards to show up like i was you're welcome and for those with small hands or who just really liked reachability on the bigger iphone you technically still have it here it's buried in the accessibility settings but you can do the little swipe down on the bottom of the screen to bring the top corners within reach and that makes getting the top gestures easier with one hand i leave that on it's pretty useful sometimes now of course the other big change that comes with ditching the home button on iphone 10 is he also just ditched that fingerprint reader which means as you may have heard they needed to replace that with face id facial recognition face id on the iphone works really well most of the time it's not perfect and i think touch id was closer to perfect as far as fail rate goes but it's still impressively good here i talked about how touch id is like the gold standard for quickly and securely getting into your phone in the previous video i'll link that below the like button of course and i still believe that touch id is definitely still faster but face id can get better with software updates and with time as millions of people begin to use it i think that'll happen and it still also has some physical limitations that you can become aware of and avoid just like touch id had some physical limitations that you could become aware of like when your finger is wet or it doesn't quite work because of stuff on your hands or if you have a glove on stuff like that you just know touch id is not going to work so you put in the passcode face id has some physical limitations too it works by bouncing thousands of little infrared dots off your face and back into the sensor and creating a map of your eyes nose and mouth it doesn't actually use the front-facing camera and it can learn a changing face over time it still recognizes you when you get a haircut or shave a beard or put makeup on none of this stuff has a huge effect on the dot map it made of your face it also won't be tricked by a picture of you because that doesn't have the depth of your face and i can also work through some pairs of sunglasses again the ones where the infrared light can get through but face id has been known to fail when you're backlit or when there's like a ton of extra infrared light coming in basically from the sun it's like how a dim flashlight doesn't work when it's really bright out same thing face id is gonna get blinded by all that extra infrared light just gotta type in your passcode but those times for me were few and far between if touch id's success rate was 99 to me it felt like face id's success rate was like 95 percent now that can add up when you unlock your phone hundreds of times a day but again this can get better as it gets used more there's even some settings as well where you can turn attention on so it won't unlock if you're just holding the phone up to your face not only that but you have to be looking at your phone then it'll unlock and show all your notification data works pretty well for me just please don't do this while driving and even if face id is this workaround to not getting the fingerprint reader underneath the glass in time for this phone i still think that at its best facial recognition on a phone is closer to secure seamless authentication than a separate fingerprint reader ever would be because with this you just pick up the phone and it works you use it you log in you pay for stuff you download apps etc but if someone else picks up your phone it won't work it's that simple and then there is an emoji possibly maybe the most fun feature of iphone 10 but you know it's hilarious these moving facial tracking animoji are iphone 10 exclusive you can't get this on any other iphone so if you get one of these then you know the person that sent it has an iphone 10. and weirdly enough if you send this to someone with an android phone they just get a video message of this animoji but here's the thing animoji is just using the front-facing camera check this out animoji is working and continues to work even when you cover the depth sensors and the extra front-facing sensors all that stuff it'll work when you cover everything except for the front-facing camera which means they totally could have made these available for any other iphone but they didn't man animoji is the classic i have an iphone and you don't feature classic apple iphone x also has some slightly new cameras same exact sensors for both cameras as the iphone 8 plus but slightly better glass and now both are optically stabilized so this is going to get you some meaningfully better performance with the 2x telephoto lens and zoomed in photos and zoomed in videos things like that which is good to see because i avoided using it with previous iphones and as you'd expect photos from the iphone 10 look awesome i'm especially happy with how much dynamic range we're getting hdr on previous iphone cameras used to be a lot less aggressive and i kept asking over and over for a little more a little more and now photos really pop the sky is like always so blue detail is there color accuracy is tight it's not as good as the pixel 2's camera just gonna say that right up front but this is a top five smartphone camera no doubt if you want a video sample check out the tesla rap video i'll link it below that's five minutes of 4k video from the sensor right there if you want to watch that and despite its tendency to overexpose i think it might be the best front-facing camera for video for any smartphone they've also added portrait mode to the front-facing camera for portrait selfies on the 10 but it doesn't work nearly as well edges get blurred super hard almost to a comical amount when you compare it to something like the pixel 2 or even the back facing camera but the thing is pixel 2 does all this so much better because of machine learning and software so in theory iphone 10 can keep learning and get this good too plus it already has better color accuracy so i'll be on the lookout for that software update now you may have noticed we've made it all this way into an iphone review without talking about any of the specs it shows how important that is but iphone 10 is rocking the a11 bionic chip and three gigs of ram and it's awesome in fact it's really really good i would say this is the most powerful mobile chipset in any smartphone right now the benchmarks are insane but this isn't for ios this is for all the things that run on top of ios the augmented reality apps the image processing the super slow motion video all that stuff but ios is still ios as you know i mean it obviously feels more modern because of all the swiping and the gestures now but as far as functionality it has all the same stuff and features you're used to has all the same quirks you're used to like ios notification system is still a mess since they don't group apps together this is still easily fixable but there's plenty of other things i wish would be different about ios too but it's apple they're stubborn you'll get used to it and battery life on the iphone 10 has turned out to be pretty great close to the iphone 8 plus i would say again iphone is a champ of standby time and it always has been so no problems there and it handles the biggest iphone display ever pretty well thanks to it being an oled i haven't had any problems getting to the end of a single day with full use if you want to use that screen on time metric it's usually around six hours so the bottom line and the question that i get the most often about this phone is so what do you think uh and if you made it this far in the video you already know what i think but in case you skip to this part this is my favorite iphone ever by far i really like it uh is it worth a thousand dollars honestly i don't think people spending the money on this phone will be disappointed now that's not to say this thing is perfect it clearly still also has its downsides you know the fact that it's all glass on the back more breakable that's a downside the notch on the front for a lot of people that's a downside no headphone jack still a downside but those are all things that i think people who are buying this phone are already used to or were expecting and for that reason it's not a deal breaker in 2017 so i'm happy to be carrying this phone so if you were thinking about going out and getting this phone go ahead i think you'll like it too until the next one this has been mkbhd thank you for watching talk to you guys in the next one peace [Music] you 
14,DyX-QZZBgpw,iPhone 11 Pro Review: For the Love of Cameras!,2019-09-20T01:42:25Z,"{'viewCount': '9076117', 'likeCount': '194559', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '16168'}",[Music] welcome to the review of the iphone 11 pro [Music] right off the bat i don't really agree with the names i don't think there's enough pro about these phones that could have been to warrant putting pro in the name but the names don't really matter what does matter is these are the highest end phones that apple makes right now in 2019. the truth is these are mostly pretty familiar phones to last year which was also pretty familiar to the year before but you already knew that what's new is apple's really focused on four major things for this new iphone so the design barely the new display slight upgrade the battery life major and these new cameras so the design does grow on you not gonna lie we saw those renders and the models and nobody thought they were pretty including me but as usual getting them in your hand and actually looking at them in person is a different thing and it doesn't look horrible i love the new matte finish i think that helps a lot the way it looks the way it feels even if it is technically a little bit slipperier than glossy i will take a matte option in any phone every time the camera square is the weird looking part i'm just happy we got memes out of it uh and it's funny for whatever reason the camera square looks indented even though it's sticking out it's all cut from one piece of glass and it's kind of like this weird optical illusion i guess but this is the design that apple's crafted for the iphone 11 pro camera bumps in a camera square and yes it rocks slightly when it's on a table apple does say that this is quote the toughest glass in any smartphone i'm not going to test that but let's be real glass is glass so you definitely want to protect it or at least try not to drop it it probably still will shatter but the good news is it doesn't seem to scratch as much as the pixel 3's matte black glass that this reminded me of so the matte finish and the camera layout are the only really new things back here with the design if it comes down to it if you don't want to have to think about it anymore or just want to avoid any chance of fingerprints or scratches you can grab a grip from our channel sponsor dbrand and this matte black robot skin on it is actually a limited edition thing so link below if you want to check that out but around the front of the phone it's going to look like almost exactly the same thing as last year same screen sizes and resolutions same notch same bezels literally you could put it next to last year's phone and you might have a hard time telling which one's which this is the new one here so this is what's actually different apple said they've improved face id to be up to 30 faster in the same space and work at a larger variety of angles i can vouch for a tiny bit faster and you'll only really notice this if they're side by side with the old phone but you know what i'll take that improvement anyway because it's for security and that's better than nothing but the variety of angles thing i don't know about you but when i read that i was hoping that meant it could sit on a table in front of you and still read and unlock your face like it couldn't before but it still doesn't do that unfortunately you still got to do that lean onto whatever surface the phone is on to unlock it so i've noticed honestly no improvement here in the angles it's basically the same other than that the buttons are very very slightly lower on each phone i don't know if anyone else has shown that but that's true i guess maybe it's a little easier to reach and they've also upgraded the water resistance a bit still ip68 certified and this phone is very slightly thicker and heavier i didn't really notice the thickness but i did notice the weight especially in the pro max this big phone is 20 grams heavier than last year and i could tell it's a bit of a chunker but you know what that's perfectly fine because battery life is back to being excellent on this phone as a result this is also achieved by getting rid of 3d touch so rip apple watch is really the only new apple product now with 3d touch shipping in it but by getting rid of that pressure sensitive display hardware that's allowed more space in the phone for a bigger battery it's true the teardowns have shown it the battery is bigger so that's why the battery difference from the 10r to the 11 was one hour that's just a13 bionic improvements but the improvement from the 10s to the 11 pro was four hours because getting rid of that 3d touch hardware has left room for more bigger batteries i don't know if i can measure that four to five hour claim but from my experience battery life has been excellent i'm getting you know my use of super high brightness high end everything on all the time i'm getting seven to eight hours of screen on time and a full day of battery pretty much every day on this phone so that's really impressive you can probably kill it in a day but you'd have to really try now back to that display for a second i mentioned they got rid of 3d touch this has been mostly replaced by haptic touch which is essentially long presses that bring back almost all the functionality from 3d pressing it's not quite as good as the peak and pop was but i hardly use that anyway and there's also something new about the display specifically that it can hold a higher 800 nits of brightness and at small points for brief moments can peak up to 1200 nits which is incredible on a smartphone display and also it's up to a 2 million to 1 contrast ratio so of course they had to name it they named it the super retina display xdr the name is pretty lame but the display is impressive again indoors and outdoors now could you tell the difference side by side with a 10s watching a youtube video or playing a game or even scrolling instagram probably not but there are certain times certain times when watching a movie or something in hdr where you can notice that improved brightness and it looks great and the sound is also pretty good thanks to the improved speakers even though there's still a notch you know the highest iphone display has always been pretty great and this is no exception it's better again but i can't help but think what would customers have noticed more a slightly improved brightness or shrinking the notch a bunch you know that's something we'll get more into later for now what you need to know is the iphone 11 pro and pro max have even better awesome high resolution oled displays again and they're also a bit more efficient contributing to even more battery gains so that's worth it oh and the specs they almost don't matter on an iphone review but since people are always curious it is the new a13 bionic chip this year which is excellent and four gigs of ram in these pro phones according to geekbench it's still extremely fast as any new phone should be most of these improvements over the a12 are just going to help these stay faster for longer and as it's been said they'll be appreciated more near the end of the phone's life than the beginning all right i almost can't believe i made you guys wait this long for the cameras so clearly the cameras are if you've watched any of the ads or any of the presentation videos these cameras are the main focus for the iphone 11 pro yes that's a pun so you've seen it we're looking at triple cameras now three new sensors so you have the primary 12 megapixel sensor a 2x telephoto camera and a 0.5 x ultrawide camera about 120 degree field of view and it's true the iphone 11's cameras are a big improvement over the 10s in broad daylight i would go as far as saying this has been an a plus camera often taking the best sharpest and cleanest photos i've seen a smartphone take colors are great they're realistic so not too over processed dynamic range is excellent and of course with subjects their tonal mapping is next level it's really good which helps it of course in tougher shooting scenarios where it's improved a lot over the 10s so the typical iphone 11 pro photo is i think the closest to what the human eye sees of any smartphone camera and i'm including the pixel on that which tends to be a little contrastier a little more dramatic but then of course the ultra wide camera finally i've been waiting for this i've been waiting to see what an iphone ultra wide camera would look like lg done it samsung did it motorola did it asus did it oneplus did it huawei did it everyone had already done it ultrawide we just wanted to see basically what google and apple would do with their new cameras so we finally have an iphone ultra wide and it's uh it's fine it's pretty good it's actually really fun the main advantage should be consistency with the other lenses and color wise white balance wise it is it's very consistent but in quality and detail thanks to the smaller sensor and slower glass it is still noticeably a step down it's softer there's a little more noise reduction doing more smoothing on the ultrawide camera so it's just generally not as good quality as the main camera which is to be expected but that doesn't stop it from being awesome to have for these new fun perspectives and all the awesomeness that comes with an ultrawide camera the new ui also in iphone's camera app is improved for the first time in a while you know they've simplified a few controls brought them to the bottom where you can reach with one hand and now when you open it you get a preview of what's going to show up in the ultra wide if you switch to it but i i don't really want that there i i think it's kind of cool that it shows what you could see but when i just want to take a normal photo it's kind of distracting it lags behind a little the actual framing and it's not perfectly aligned all the time so i want to turn it off but i can't it will fade out automatically when it detects that you're taking a photo of a close-up subject since i guess it recognizes that ultra wise or more for landscapes or far away subjects and then it'll come back automatically when you put that close subject away but yeah i want to be able to just shut it completely off there's also now finally a dedicated night mode which turns on automatically when it thinks it's dark enough but sometimes it's kind of dim and it doesn't turn on when you want it to but there's no way to manually turn on night mode which isn't very pro but okay when you do get it turned on the ui is excellent it gives you exposure equivalence so you can turn up or down live and it will go for way longer times if it detects you're on a tripod or stabilized and you can see the picture sort of brighten up as it's being taken almost like it's exposing the frame in real time which is pretty sick and the shots you can get now at night and in low light on the iphone are very good there's no clear overall winner i think for best night mode right now in my opinion they also do it a different way here's my take night mode is good enough that i wish i could turn it on more often i think the natural curious comparison here is with pixel's night sight the pixel definitely tends to brighten up photos more and uh bring shadows up bring highlights up you can it's it's more of like a night time to daytime transformation sort of situation happening there with pixel where the iphone is a bit more true to life and then it's also taking what i think are the most detailed sharpest low-light photos of any smartphone even more so than the pixel but in dim light it just it doesn't turn on very much and there is no night mode in the ultrawide camera so really it's a great start but no doubt it can get better over time i think this will make a really good blind smartphone camera test if we if we do like a separate bracket specifically for phones that have a dedicated night mode now which is a lot of them i think that could be really good but just in general i am really happy that there's this new focus on smartphone cameras i feel like the last year of presentations of smartphones have had more time spent on the camera than any other feature and they're all just fighting against each other to try to make the best possible camera to put in our pockets and we win from that the iphone 11 pro still does the best video of any smartphone that's still pretty clear to me and they're also making it easier now in the ui to just quickly start taking a video so if you see something you like you open the camera up and just hold down the shutter button and it just starts recording so just like instagram or snapchat and if you want to lock it into video recording you just drag it over to the right and it's hands-free you're taking a video but yeah in the photo front the competition is pretty stiff and it's coming from all different directions we're about to get pixel 4 we just had the new huawei mate 30 pro come out oneplus 7t is right around the corner you can count on that stuff and then i just want to touch on ios 13 for a second so i've been using it in beta on my iphone 10s max before this came out so i've already used the things you get again here like dark mode and the long presses and quick settings and stuff like that it's great a bunch of little tweaks here and there but i gotta say it has been kind of buggy i've had some weird issues with lock screen controls just not showing up sometimes sometimes the camera app just freezes all together until i close it and then i've had some other weird app issues with like the tesla app and instagram app but now those are fixed so yeah i should definitely mention that hopefully ios 13.1 and future software updates will iron a lot of this stuff out otherwise it's ios as you'd expect it also for those wondering the u1 chip in these new phones which should again basically give you ultra wide band signal for referential locating of other u1 enabled devices and should improve airdrop that's not enabled in this version of the software i think that's also coming in 13.1 um aside from that we don't really know what else it does but generally the software experience of the iphone is pretty much unchanged same ui same feature set you already know what it is nothing is dramatically or drastically different here beyond i think night mode so i'm not super surprised here look you you probably don't need an iphone 11 pro but it is a great upgrade like especially when a lot of these improvements even though they're small are on such core functional things to normal people like speed battery life and camera like if you were to ask normal people what they care about the most in their phone it's those things but i've said it before and i'll say it again a lot of the features that i was looking forward to especially when we heard it was going to be a pro phone are just not here and that's got me hyped way too early for this 2020 iphone or the iphone 12 or whatever they call that and actually new design shrinking the notch maybe usb type c of course a high refresh rate pro motion display that would have been super pro uh putting touch id back underneath the display glass reverse wireless charging any of these things in this phone would have been would have would have felt a little more pro and would have maybe made it worth the name or just felt really cool to have but of course none of it happened so really the focus for this new iphone 11 pro has come down to the a13 the battery life the slightly improved display and just these new cameras you want it you got it if you're just someone who wants the best possible camera in your phone or if you do a lot of video creation or if you're a pro content creator on your phone then you're going to be really happy with this phone with the new iphone classic or even with the new iphone 11 non-pro which is 300 cheaper and has the same cameras and same processing and a great battery life minus the telephoto but again that much cheaper price that'll get its own review but i'll say as a whole the iphone 11 pro is a really great phone and unless you have the 10s it's probably worth the upgrade just for the love of cameras but really the big looming reason for someone like me not to get this phone is the 2020 iphone or the next iphone so that's something to think about but we'll stay ready for that as i expect a lot more but this package they've shipped today it's pretty damn good either way that's been it thank you for watching catch you guys the next one peace you 
15,TnkdoEZhTbc,iPhone 13 Pro Review: Better Than You Think!,2021-10-02T00:40:12Z,"{'viewCount': '9412411', 'likeCount': '232571', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '12475'}",[Music] to the center of the center the iphone 13 pro and 13 pro max are better than you think so really there's only three things about this phone that are genuinely better than the regular 13. and one of them you could argue maybe not that many people are actually going to notice but the other two are pretty big jumps and so this feels like a pretty big upgrade disguised in the same design as last year so i've reviewed the iphone 13 already it was earlier this week there i go over cinematic mode and the new a15 bionic and a smaller notch etc this pro phone has all of that but then on top of that the three major things that this phone does better than the regular 13 would be the screen the battery and the cameras and everything in wait marquez that's the same list of three things you said was better about the 13 than the 12 you'd be right but this takes a bigger leap in all those things so to start with the screen the 13 pro is the same size as the 13 and the 13 pro max is bigger again same sizes and resolutions as last year but now there's a smaller notch neat okay looks a little better on the bigger screen even though there is no more information on that extra screen but then the display is actually noticeably brighter here even versus the 13. it hits a thousand nits max brightness versus the 800 on the 13 and even 1200 in its peak with hdr and it's really good it's viewable everywhere outdoors great responsive auto brightness and it's still one of the most color accurate oled panels out there but what we're really here for finally is apple's pro phones now getting pro motion meaning an adaptive high refresh rate display it's about damn time now this has been really interesting to watch unfold because it's not just a matter of dropping 120 hertz display into the phone and then calling it a day there's a couple different considerations and nuances and things to be able to do to do it well and then there's whether or not people even notice that's two different things so as a self-proclaimed pixel enthusiast as someone who's seen a lot of phones apple has done this really well and it's of course an oled but it's also an ltpo display meaning it's an adaptive variable refresh rate that can ramp up to 120 hertz but also now down to as low as 10 hertz it actually has 12 different refresh rates that it cycles between which is seven more than the ipad pro so this helps it respond to exactly what's happening on the display so if you're watching a 24 fps movie the display only needs to refresh 24 times per second but if you're scrolling through a website or social media it'll be nice and smooth maybe if you're gaming it's pinned at 120 hertz but if you're just sitting on a home screen or reading some text like an email nothing's happening on the screen it can go all the way down to 10 hertz which can save battery so this tech has been around for years and other phones and it's great so the interesting part is different phones ramp up at different times and for different reasons and different amounts so an example is like no matter how high refresh rate of an android phone i have it's always 60 hertz for google maps anytime i open google maps the whole rest of the phone notification panel using the app it's all 60 hertz probably to save battery because it's a gps heavy app but that's one thing it always does so it turns out there have been a lot of places where people have noticed the iphone doesn't ramp all the way up to 120 hertz in fact a lot of places in third party apps where it still stays at 60. now i've noticed just from using a whole ton of different apps i was actually pretty impressed by how many are already using 120hz animations and all these apps inside and out felt smoother and more responsive also all of ios is smoother and more responsive but for those that don't apple has put out detailed instructions on how to make it easy for developers to update their apps to fully support promotion exactly the way they want to so when your favorite apps get updated hopefully the developers include it but all that being said will regular people who get this phone even notice promotion this is something i've thought a lot about especially since the announcement you know of course lots of other phones have gotten higher fresh rate in the past but because it's an iphone this is for millions of people who have only ever seen a 60hz phone their entire lives this will be the first time they ever see a high refresh trade screen on a phone and so this is this is the thing i've been talking about for so long so when i actually first got this phone i started handing it to people you know discreetly of course but handing it to them like hey do you notice anything different about this phone like swipe around maybe hold it next to your current phone do you feel like it feels any different and i'll be the first to admit not as many people immediately noticed it as i was hoping like you know different people had different things about it that they noticed like there's a really good video by joshua chang where he did that same thing he handed the phone to a bunch of people and they all had different ways of explaining what they noticed so some of them didn't notice but some of them noticed things like text staying more crisp on the screen while you're scrolling some people just straight up noticed the better smoothness and touch responsiveness and called that out so i'll put it this way not everyone will notice promotion right away especially if they're not looking for it but but i don't have i'm not crazy it's not like i have special eyes or anything so i guarantee you this if you get somebody used to 120 hertz or just high refresh rate in general and they use this phone for a couple weeks a couple months and then you hand them back a 60 hertz phone they will notice that difference and they won't want to switch back to it basically i think people who buy this pro iphone and get used to promotion won't want to switch back to a 60hz iphone just like people who switch to a higher fresh rate android phone don't want to switch back either but also i'm kind of hoping apple doesn't ship another 60hz iphone next year they definitely could but i'm hoping like 90 hertz at least something like that either way that's my stance on the higher fresh rate the promotion in the pro iphones clearly the implementation technically speaking is pretty great it's super color accurate it's very bright it looks great and it's very smooth so despite the notch and some apps needing to be updated it's one of the best looking screens on any phone right now and going with ltpo let these phones with their new higher fresh rates also be battery champs so this is the second big thing about these new phones which is holy smokes man the batteries got really good now there's a couple different compounding factors that all pile on top of each other to make this happen the fact that the pro motion dips below 60 hertz to save you battery when you don't need it is number one but number two the a15 bionic is more efficient than last year and then the fact that these phones are actually slightly thicker and heavier to support an actually larger battery is a really big number three so the battery inside the 13 pro is about 11 larger than the 12 pro and the 13 pro max cell is about 18 larger than the 12 pro max that's not a small amount and you can't actually feel it in the weight these new phones are about 20 grams heavier than last year and probably heavier than the phone you're holding right now and the results have been dope i've mostly been dailying the 13 pro here and getting six seven hours of screen on time no problem never really killing the phone in a day i'd consider that an a and david's been testing the 13 pro max here at the studio and getting crazy endurance numbers he had a day with five hours of screen on time with 50 battery left which is nuts so i'm gonna go ahead and put the iphone 13 pro max right up at the top of the battery champ 2021 power rankings right now alongside a bunch of other phones with like the super massive batteries like the rog phone 5 and the moto g power so screens check batteries check but once again the biggest change with these new pro phones is the cameras again so first of all i really like that the 13 pro and 13 pro max have the exact same set of cameras between them so the phones are basically identical except for screen size and battery size so that's nice uh but yeah once again big leap up with the pro phones and their cameras and they've got the camera bump to go with it and it really is a massive like three layer camera bump with this phone if you don't have a case on the phone you'll immediately notice it sits up higher it rocks more from certain corners on a table and it just kind of looks at you funny remember when we thought the iphone 12 pro had huge cameras yeah no this is next level these are much larger sensors and cameras in here so we've got triple cameras still got lidar and a mic and a flash and each of these cameras is better than last year in its own way so the primary 12 megapixel camera with that even larger sensor shift stabilization is excellent it's remarkably consistent through various lighting and indoor and outdoor scenarios there's also of course the photographic styles to choose from that i talked about in the previous video i landed on rich contrast as my favorite and honestly just left it there for most of my photos main thing you'll notice that makes it better is the big sensor look that we had only in the pro max last year so this natural bokeh is so easy now that you might find yourself having to tap to focus just a little bit more just to make sure you're focused on the right thing and you'll find that you can get that natural background blur much easier it's not always perfect there's it's still tiny smartphone optics but the natural blur is better than fake portrait mode blur every time so it does a great job not fringing also like some other big smartphone sensors do the telephoto is also better this year so it's once again a bigger sensor and it's also now a 3x optical zoom instead of a 2x or 2.5 x from last year and it looks almost as good as the main sensor so you love to see that that consistency between different cameras gives you the confidence to be able to switch between cameras like it doesn't even matter which one you're using and that's more true this year than ever before now it's no s21 ultra you know you're not going to do that deep double digit zooming very well some of the best periscope zooms literally look crisp at 10x while the iphone is maxing out at 15 and it looks like a watercolor painting there so it's going to be up to you to decide if that's something you care about having in your phone or not and then last but not least the ultra wide again closing in on the corner to corner sharpness of the main camera it's not quite there but this is this is one area where i was maybe hoping to see a higher resolution because you're spreading this pixel count over such a wide focal range maybe 16 24 megapixels even would have been cool to see just to get that true matching sharpness nevertheless the photos and videos from the ultrawide are world class literally tops among any ultrawides in any smartphone and it's now also capable of macro photography unlike the ultra wide in the 13 and 13 mini and honestly it's pretty good so you can get pretty close right up to about two centimeters minimum focus distance and there's a pretty good amount of you know chromatic aberration and fringing and artifacting around the outside of the frames but as long as you tap to focus you can get a pretty good close-up right in the middle and it's way better than any crappy 2-megapixel macro camera has ever dreamed of being now i mentioned during the impressions video the pro phones are doing this auto switching where if something comes within about 14 centimeters of the camera it automatically switches to the ultra wide in macro mode doesn't tell you and doesn't let you manually switch back honestly it's the most annoying part of using this camera to me i take plenty of close-ups of objects because i have no friends i guess and every time i switch to the ultrawides macro it produces an objectively worse looking photo so apple's reached out and they have said sense that they do plan on adding a toggle to let you manual out of that macro mode i hope it gets added soon it should be a software update can't wait for it because my photos are suffering you know there's still no astrophotography mode in the iphone even though in night mode you can sometimes see some stars if you hold the phone still for long enough and there's no pro mode for manual control over photos or for videos that's still going to require a third party app to really dig into that stuff what they did add is cinematic video mode which i talked about in the 13 review to summarize it's a 1080p 30fps hdr video portrait mode and i really don't think it's the answer when it comes to taking the reins and making the best videos possible on your iphone at least not yet i mean if you want to tailor a whole entire shoot around focus racking then yes the iphones will punch above their weight class but i found myself using the regular video mode or even third-party apps to get the best video out of the iphone still but you know it would actually help to get better video out of the iphone prores video giant asterisk that's not in the phones yet so the pro iphones should also ideally in a software update be getting prores video for those unfamiliar that's a high quality video codec that's used all over the professional industry it's a pretty sweet should be awesome to be able to shoot prores video from your phone mix it with other cameras bring it into your editor and just start chopping that couple other small asterisks though one prores video would be 4k 30 on every pro iphone except the 128 gig base storage versions those will max out at 1080p 30fps it's unclear if this is because you'd just fill up the storage too fast and they didn't want to let you you know there could be some merit to that 4k is big files it's like six gigs per minute you could theoretically fill up the whole phone in two hours if you just shot all day but also it could be because the slower storage that's typically used in lower pricing lower tiered models of less storage might not have supported it in the first place it's a high data rate one or the other maybe both i don't know but just know as long as if you're planning on getting a pro iphone just to shoot 4k prores video you'll have to get at least a 256gb version and you can actually go all the way up to one terabyte of total storage but the tough part about having a one terabyte iphone 13 pro full of huge prores files is offloading that to your computer via lightning at those awful speeds is going to take forever it's not exactly a pro workflow it's so brutal that for all the big game apple always talks about usbc and the ipad and every other thing they do and thunderbolt it's just never made it to the iphone matter of fact let me use this as a segue for all the things that i wish this iphone pro had for a thousand dollars number one usb type c probably never gonna happen but i can still dream and then faster charging and i don't mean the 27 watts that the pro max can apparently support from a higher powered brick that's not included in the box i mean like real 50 65 watt maybe even higher wattage charging someday that again is probably never gonna happen and i've made a whole video about why apple hasn't done that and some other things like high resolution cameras etc i'll leave a link below the like button but nevertheless pro max's huge battery still takes a very long time to charge and i wish there was an all black option ah minor detail there's always a case or skin for that but there's a couple other minor things that didn't quite fit into this full review so you can turn down the refresh rate of the display to 60 hertz limited but it's not in the display settings like in every other phone it's in accessibility settings under motion and then limit frame rate i haven't tested this for more than about a few minutes but i have a feeling it won't actually save that much battery on this phone considering it's actively bringing you down below 60 hertz all the time anyway then if if you're using a magsafe duo charger which i actually do when i'm traveling the new camera bump on the 13 pro is so big that it actually gets pretty close to the wireless charging coil to the point where if you have a case on your phone it actually pops the phone up slightly off the charger now it still works but i'd be careful what case you buy just in case you get one with a camera bump that's too big and now suddenly it doesn't make contact with the charger anymore and then the new sierra blue color just so you know is a little paler in person than it looks in the press materials and on apple's site just warning you you know it's a slightly bluish silver not that that's a bad thing just a warning i'll try to show it as best i can with all the footage from the shiny new raptor camera so the minor upgrade turns out to be pretty solid after all spoiler alert every iphone upgrade from here till the end of time is it's gonna be a minor upgrade that's the way smartphones are but look there's nothing wrong with a small upgrade in my opinion that's how you eventually get great at something is by getting a little bit better every time you do it i would know that's how i've gotten better at making videos and that's exactly what i went over in my skillshare course so skillshare is an online learning community for creatives where you can find thousands of classes for creative and curious people on all kinds of topics illustration photography and now making mkbhd videos like i've said before i'm self-taught at pretty much everything we do here and that's like the number one comment i get anytime we try something a little new or different like car videos or something there's always comments like oh you're not good at that just stick to regular tech videos but how do you think people who are good at car videos started they had to get started somewhere and just get a little bit better over time so i've taken some skillshare courses myself and there's even one on animating four youtube videos uh by evan from the polymatter channel that i'm super into and he is also self-taught so hey if you start seeing you know slightly better animations here and there on the channel maybe some of that is michael who's of course doing world-class animations here but maybe some of that is me chipping in which would be nice but yeah for my skillshare class it's my fundamentals for how we put together these mkbhd videos that's what it's all about so skillshare is also curated specifically for learning so there's no ads so you can stay focused and it's less than 10 bucks a month for an annual membership so here's the deal skillshare was kind enough to sponsor this video and give the first thousand of you that click the link below in the description a free trial to a premium membership and what can be better than that so you can get started with your learning and your creativity but that's pretty much it for the 13 pro let me know what you think of this phone in the comments section below we can talk about it thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace [Music] 
16,SdLShOCvVeM,iPhone 14 Pro Review: This Will Be Copied!,2022-09-14T13:01:12Z,"{'viewCount': '12422265', 'likeCount': '347645', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '18896'}",foreign [Music] [Music] 14 pro so this might be a little bit inside baseball but typically when you're testing a new product an unreleased product from Apple they tell you to keep the testing a secret don't let anyone know you have it don't display it publicly don't show it to anyone that would be breaking the NDA and that's still true about this new iPhone 14 pro but I'll tell you what I was able to walk around take pictures text people pay for things with Apple pay and nobody even blinked an eye because it looks exactly the same as the iPhone 13 Pro this is still of course a new phone though for a new year and so really there are three major things that are new with the 14 pro those being the internals the display and the cameras and so I'm going to sort of chapter those things off to go over each of them but of course also worth mentioning is this new MKBHD Edition Chevron hoodie finally finally available in the MKBHD store mkbhd.com it's very comfortable but also hoodie season [Music] yeah on and on so there's not a whole lot of new pieces in this new phone but there's technically more in this one than the Baseline iPhone 14 because this one actually gets the Silicon upgrade to the new a16 bionic and six gigs of RAM top of the line new four nanometer system on a chip from Apple you could tell though when they gave the presentation in the keynote that it must be a pretty minor bump from the a15 bionic because they went straight to comparing it to the a13 bionic from a couple years ago in real life though so far it's benchmarked very similar to an a15 bionic just slightly above as expected and that's meant for me Rock Solid performance fluid animations and are pretty reliable all-day battery life from both the 14 pro and 14 pro Max but I'm going to get more into battery in a minute also technically new to the internals is a new set of sensors it's an improved gyroscope and a better accelerometer to be able to tell if you've been in a car crash or Not Crash detection cool feature so it'll detect if you've been in a car crash or not and then if you don't respond to the prompts on screen it'll automatically call Emergency Services great I'm not going to test that I'm sure some other YouTubers will find a way to test it but actually my question really was like okay if you're going to test it what sort of things do you test and I guess the answer is accidental triggers like you know how you'll if you run up a flight of stairs or something and you have automatic workout detection on the Apple watch it'll go oh have you started a workout because you've got an elevated heart rate and you just started to running no just me I don't know I was just wondering if there's other times I might accidentally think that's something else like a car crash might have happened maybe you've got a dbrand case on it and you just drop it on the floor or something I don't know it hits the ground hard enough thinks it might have crashed but then the more you look at it the more you realize there's a bunch of different sensors and factors where it sees okay your GPS location was going 60 miles an hour until it hit zero miles an hour and the microphones heard a loud noise and the barometric pressure changed when the airbags went off and also the gyroscope saw that there was a hard stopping force it knows you run a car crash one more thing that used to be in the iPhone that's not anymore and this one is a physical SIM card tray this is actually for the US only and these phones are now e-sim only esim isn't exactly a new thing but not having a physical SIM tray anymore does have its pros and cons pros mainly being okay it's one less place for water to get in one less moving part but cons being that for international travel if you just wanted to grab a SIM card real quick instead of going through the carriers that's no longer nearly as easy I'm going to keep an eye on this because I imagine Apple intends to eventually expand this to all iPhones instead of what it's now which is just starting in the US only but then the last internal change for the iPhone 14s all of them is satellite connectivity this is an edge case extra feature that you're honestly hoping you never ever have to use but in the off chance that you're stranded somewhere with absolutely no cellular service at all you're nowhere near a cell tower the iPhone's antenna is now impressively can also communicate with straight up satellites instead of cell towers so it'll take longer and you'll need a clear view of the sky and the UI will literally help you point your phone at a certain satellite overhead but it will let you send messages to a dispatcher or local emergency services to help get to your location and what you need help with that is also pretty clutch I will also not be testing that but that's it for internals uh notice I didn't talk much about the externals like I usually do in phone reviews because if we're being honest they're pretty much the same uh there are some new colors the space black which is my favorite in years and there's also a new purple color from certain angles you can hardly even tell it's purple but if it hits the light you know for a pro phone that's a solid purple I guess really only the camera bumps change they are definitely slightly larger and thicker than the 13 Pros but bottom line is when an iPhone 13 Pro can fit in an iPhone 14 Pro's case and you know it's pretty close in return okay so now we're really getting into the meat of what you really start to notice on these new phones iPhone 14 pro and 14 pro Max have some slightly updated 6.1 inch and 6.7 inch OLED displays respectively so there's still excellent displays on paper with slightly thinner bezels that you won't notice and slightly higher resolution that you also won't notice and an even higher brighter 2000 nits Peak brightness that you absolutely will notice when looking at the phone on like a bright sunny day it looks great at 100 out in the sun but the two things you'll notice the most often here are the dynamic Island and the always-on display the always-on display is the perfect example of the classic apple late mover strategy like this is not a new feature this has been on hundreds of phones before for many years but now it's finally coming to an iPhone and so it's being done the apple way this time the thing is I don't really know that there's any advantages to this apple way so the always on display looks like this so you hit the power button you sleep the phone you put it down the brightness drops the ltpo OLED display goes all the way down to one Hertz and you get to see the clock and notifications roll in as if your lock screen is still on just at a lower brightness this is a pretty bright always-on display though you can see that right like it you get used to it after a few days but I constantly was looking over at my phone on my desk thinking it was still on which is like a lower brightness but yeah it looks like that all the time the transition from the home screen to the always on display is really nice it's got this smooth fade animation and I think that's the Apple Way like the clock if it's behind something will graduate to the front of the oasan display and it maintains all the colors and skin tones and whatever wallpaper you were using so it's not faded or black and white you still have all your color if you've got music playing then your album art is front and center it is extra beautiful but I don't really care about any of that to be honest and there's also no extra customization like I've seen some really creative always-on displays over the years that let me customize and dial in even differently from the lock screen and I really love using them apples is just a toggle in the display settings on or off that's it me personally I'm gonna be turning it off on this phone because it also seems to be affecting battery life slightly more than I expected now the always-on display specifically doesn't show up in the battery settings so I'm kind of just estimating here based on my behavior everything else looks normal but I am getting slightly worse battery life than I've expected and then I've had on the 13 Pro for the past year and so I assume that's this that's a little extra brightness gone a long way it does still know when to turn off don't get me wrong if it's in a pocket it turns off if you're in sleep mode it turns off even when you have an Apple Watch on and you walk far enough away from the phone that it knows you can't see it anymore it turns off the always-on display but it does just sit here on my desk all day showing me stuff and I I don't really use it all that much so yeah I'm gonna pass but you know what is new on the screen that I absolutely love and will never pass on the dynamic Island baby what a terrible name they felt the need to name the notch it is such a minor feature in the grand scheme of using a phone but it's a good one it's a really good one so here's what's happening remember the rumors of the new Pro iPhone replacing the notch with an eye shaped cutout in the top of the display with all those renders people made well that's actually what this is it has one circular cut out on the right for a new selfie camera and one pill-shaped cutout on the left for the new face ID Hardware which they've shrunk down by about 30 percent to fill in this smaller area and then instead of just doing that Apple has cleverly decided to fill in the gap between them with black pixels and make it one big pill so then the idea is Apple would much rather think about the pill as software than Hardware so they built a whole bunch of software features around it so it just has a resting state like this which doesn't show up in screenshots or screen recordings it's just a gap but there are about 30 different things that it does to indicate ongoing activities and background activities and things that are all beautifully animated and super smooth these fluid physics it's so friendly and approachable and all of these things that it does show up in screenshots and Screen recordings the best part is pretty much everything works straight out the box as you'd expect it to so I had this moment during the first impressions video where I was like oh can't wait for Apple music to use it but then Spotify to take like a year and a half to actually update their app to work with this but nope everything works straight out the box including Spotify because that already uses the now playing API they already had a lock screen widget same with SoundCloud same with YouTube music and Pocket Casts so you have album art and the color matching waveform up there while the media is playing if you tap it it'll open the app that's playing and if you long press it you actually get a widget that pops up with some media controls I can scrub and everything pretty much the exact same widget that would appear in the lock screen so this feels kind of backwards I think a tap should open the widget and then a long press should open the app and that would just make more sense but whatever the point is it just works right off the rip matter of fact here's everything that the dynamic Island does right out the box on day one so it does system alerts like for incoming calls connecting air pods plugging into a charger switching the ringer to silent mode or volume on face ID unlocking connecting air pods and a whole bunch more there's our full list and then it's also a UI for live activities happening in the background so an ongoing call or music playing in the background any media a timer counting down Maps directions as you navigate in the background what voice memos recording screen recording all that stuff so here's a full list of that as well and then any third-party app that uses the now playing or call Kit apis which there are many it also has a little spot for the indicator for microphone and camera access right in between the pill and the cutout it really becomes next level when you have multiple background activities happening at once because then it low-key kind of becomes like a multitasking app switcher at the top of your phone so one background activity looks like this but then if I have a second one if I go start a new background activity it splits the island into two so now you can pick between them and then quickly swap between them with a single touch that's so sick I think as cheesy as the name is like I'm about done saying the words Dynamic Island out loud but I think this will be one of the most copied features in the smartphone World in like 18 months pretty much guarantee it like we even already saw some MIUI mods on Twitter where people trying this on other phones but the thing is it's going to be surprisingly hard to copy it exactly like this on this level it seems pretty innocuous pretty simple but there is a lot going on here like there's a new display engine in the a16 bionic that handles all these animations and there's a lot of them that really pull this whole thing together there's physics to it you just you poke the cut out and it wobbles and moves around a little like it's alive and since there are real cutouts like holes in the display for the camera and the face ID system it has to be touch sensitive in areas around the actual cutout so that it can still register Taps when you touch a dead zone on the screen and for the most part it works pretty well is this a game changing feature in a phone for most people no is this a reason to get one phone over another I don't think so no not really is this a nice quality of life touch that a lot of people will think is really cool and really like yeah yeah I think that's true is this feature technically invented by LG seven years ago with the top screen on the LG V10 yes absolutely [Music] all right if you watch enough iPhone presentations then you know that the pro iPhone really is and has been all about the cameras fun fact they spent 23 minutes on stage at the September event talking about the iPhone 14 pro and seven of those minutes about 33 percent we're just talking about the camera and so this is the biggest change at least on paper that's been made to the iPhone camera in many years look at this graph this is a graph of the megapixel count of every iPhone camera since they first came out they've been confidently repeating the 12 megapixel sensors since the iPhone 6s but this year we got a leap we got the leap the primary camera on the iPhone 14 pro is now a new 48 megapixel sensor it's 65 percent larger than the one we had on the 12 Pro it has a second generation Focus Shift Optical image stabilization 100 Focus pixels and sits behind a new f 1.78 lens I think we can all agree that's a great set of specs that we expect great imagery from but really The more I've been playing with it it's just more about what the new 48 megapixel sensor enables that's so great so a new larger 48 megapixel sensor that's going to bend down to 12 megapixels for all your normal photos but you do get the benefits of sharpness and more light Gathering From a larger sensor that also gives you faster shutter speeds to freeze motion more often in non-perfect conditions and it lets me take low light photos with a shorter shutter time which is very convenient but the larger sensor also gives you a really nice shallow natural depth of field without portrait mode more than we've ever seen from an iPhone camera now other phones I've seen do this just as well but it presents a new set of challenges like fringing and autofocus but I've been very impressed with how well the iPhone deals with both not a whole ton of fringing on close-up subjects and 100 coverage with Focus pixels has been pretty locked in on tracking subjects and keeping things in Focus even with the shallow depth of field my only complaint really is the pretty weak minimum Focus distance things get blurred when you get close to the primary camera so you got to switch to the macro mode pretty early luckily the ultra wide has some improvements too so that's not the end of the world then a 48 megapixel sensor also enables this new 2x button doesn't seem like that huge of a deal but it's literally just cropping in on the middle 12 megapixels of this huge sensor so it's essentially like an optical zoom it's not like you're going to lose quality the way anything less than 3x would have been before on iPhones because it was cropping into an already 12 megapixel image the 48 megapixel sensor also enables this new action mode and video which is this super aggressive stabilization for really shaky video and it does this with a pretty heavy crop but it's also able to still shoot in up to 2.8 K in this mode a little Pro tip it defaults to the 0.5 x camera it's much noisier when you do this so so I I do recommend switching back to the primary for it and then if you're running around chasing a subject or even pulling it out a car window or just anytime you need some pretty heavy stabilization this is definitely nice to have if you want the full 48 megapixel files you can shoot in Pro raw and it will kick out 50 60 70 megabyte dng files which have a lot of detail and latitude to push around in Lightroom and make them look better than the straight out of Camera 12 megapixel shots but I'll leave that to the Peter McKinnon's and Tyler stalman's or many other photography creators I know are going to put this to the test one thing they didn't do with the new 48 megapixel sensor is 8k video they could have they've not been able to until they crossed the 30 megapixel threshold they got to 48 they didn't do it that of course would also probably still be pretty tough considering the max iPhone is still one terabyte which sounds like a lot but then you're also working with huge five six gig per minute prores files that take forever to get off the iPhone via this lightning port in the slow speeds and they should probably just switch to USBC and that's a whole rant for another day so I'll just stop it there but just know no AK video straight from the iPhone's camera I think I can honestly safely though put the iPhone 14 pro as the best camera system in any phone in 2022. don't get me wrong it's not perfect it can definitely over bake HDR sometimes in some harsh shooting conditions and the new selfie camera which now has 12 megapixels and autofocus while it handles a variety of focal lengths much better and is sharper overall it still has a tendency to overexpose people with dark skin constantly I would know but if I'm just looking for the overall versatility of the whole camera system you know the shutter speed improvements the quality of the photos the great autofocus the color consistency between the three different cameras the overall image processing pipeline improvements that have made the ultra wide much more usable and less noisy and low light and then of course the prores video that I'm literally actively running an entire YouTube channel with then yeah I'm pretty comfortable calling this the camera King again and yes I am going to be shooting the new autofocus video with the iPhone 14 Pros cameras so if you want to large helping of sample footage that's going to be the place to go go subscribe over there plus the car is going to be that's a fun one it's going to be a good video so don't miss it anyway oh also guess what guess what cinematic mode now supports 30 FPS huh that's funny Checkmate 24 FPS stands uh no but also I don't think I'm gonna be using cinematic mode that much because the natural depth of field is so good on the primary camera but yeah 30 FPS cinematic now also remember how all those event invites went out a couple weeks ago and the theme was far out and there were all these stars and we thought oh they're going to get an astrophotography mode like a nighttime photography type thing uh that didn't happen turned out they were like hinting at the satellite connectivity but like the iPhone still gets crushed when it comes to some of the like super low light nighttime shooting and especially astrophotography so I'm kind of bummed that we didn't get that but otherwise yeah complete camera [Music] so the iPhone 14 pro is still a thousand dollars and the 14 pro Max is still eleven hundred dollars to start so they are the absolute best phones Apple makes right now and there's going to be a lot of people considering an upgrade so is it worth it well in the landscape of other phones you could get for one thousand dollars this one's gonna be competitive it's going to have the best camera of the bunch I think uh it's gonna have one of the best brightest most responsive displays of any of those phones it's also going to have a dynamic Island however you feel about that but also it's going to have the classic Suite of iPhone stuff iMessage FaceTime Classics but there definitely isn't any any flashy or any Crazy Design or Hardware Innovation Happening Here There is nothing folding in half there is no super fast charging or some massive battery size Improvement the new colors which you've seen are like yeah you can kind of tell that they're a little different looking but this is a very refined update and so really the truth is if you have an iPhone 11 or later at this point then the new iOS 16 update pushing out to your phone right now is gonna make just as big of a difference to the user experience of using your phone as getting the new phone probably would so yeah I'd say you know the new lock screen the haptic keyboard all this stuff I did a video on all the new features you can check that out but yeah this is a really good phone you should get it if you either want the latest and greatest and best of a smartphone camera available right now or if you've just got a thousand dollar hole in your pocket burning away and you just have to have the latest and greatest pro iPhone that's what this is if you're not trying to get the newest iPhone then you can skip the upgrade it and fix your current phone with parts and tools by this video's sponsor iFixit they make it super easy with free repair guides and tear Downs on their channel it's not as hard as it looks also if you want to see the inside of your phone before you try to fix it check out ifixit's channel so you can see their iPhone 14 tear down when they take apart Tech so you can learn how to fix it yourself so you can check them out at the link below one sustainability note I found interesting the iPhone 14s now across the board have a slightly improved repairability design the glass on the back is now separate from the components underneath very nice but either way that's been it thanks for watching definitely get subscribed to see the straight up standard iPhone 14 review and that comes out also the Apple watch Ultra and that comes out and about a thousand other things that are all working on here at the studio because it's Tech Timber there's a lot happening see you in the next one peace [Music] 
17,0X0Jm8QValY,iPhone 15 Review: Welcome to the Club!,2023-10-02T23:08:40Z,"{'viewCount': '3539045', 'likeCount': '114701', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '8021'}","(upbeat music) - All right, so this is Apple's brand new, latest and greatest iPhone 15. And nothing inside is new or anything that we haven't seen before in some other phone somewhere. Now that doesn't mean
it's not a good phone. You can actually be a really
good phone and not really new, they aren't mutually exclusive. And it turns out, that is actually Apple's
strategy with this phone. The more I use this phone, the more I see Apple's textbook, late mover advantage strategy
coming into play here. They're gonna take something we've literally already seen before and then do it the Apple way. So on the outside, let's see, how would I describe
this new phone's design? Kind of familiar, I don't know, somewhat reminiscent of the 14. How does Apple say it? - iPhone 15 has an all new
design that's simply gorgeous. - All new? All new? Really? Okay, I mean, I don't know about all new but this phone definitely
inherits the same looks and general design as last year again. But you know what's at least partially new is actually the way it feels in the hand. So I said this in the 15 Pro review, but they've done a good job
softening the corners here. So it still looks boxy,
still has aluminum rails, but it's more comfortable to hold, since these corners aren't as sharp, they're a little bit rounded off. And then, this is also
the first glass-backed, non-Pro iPhone with a satin back, and I am loving the satin back, this is like a nice, soft
touch, frosted glass back here. I know there's a super
complicated process too to like get this single
piece of glass on the back to be two different colors and two different
thicknesses and all that, and I can totally respect it. But honestly, the colors,
they are super weak. People were saying in the last video the the color grading must be off, it looks like it's white instead of blue. No, this blue phone really
doesn't look that blue at all in almost any lighting, it's like 1% blue. But either way, you can say between the aluminum and the pale light colors, these are also probably the most fingerprint
resistant iPhones in years. On the sides, same button placements, same speakers placements,
same mute switch, no action button on this phone. Honestly, you could probably use an iPhone 14 case on the iPhone 15. But around the front, new screen, well, not new, again, but new
to this iPhone, new screen. You now get the dynamic island on the non-Pro iPhones this year, which is very much doing the whole punch cutout the Apple way. So the notch is finally dead until maybe a new iPhone SE
brings it back, it could happen. But also, slowly, app developers
have been getting on board in useful ways over the past year. I already have a few favorites now, my airline app's giving
me real-time flight info, my weather apps, Uber, et cetera. But while we're up here talking about the screen on
this phone, it's also brighter, It's up to 2,000 knits now,
which looks awesome outdoors. But also, it's 2023, and this is an $800 phone that
still has a 60 hertz display. This is actually really fascinating to me. It's so odd. Like, on one hand, for most people buying this
phone, it's totally fine. It literally doesn't have,
it's a new baseline iPhone, have you talked to someone who
buys a new baseline iPhone? They literally don't care. It doesn't matter, it's not something they pay attention to, you could ask them right now how many frames per second their phone is and they wouldn't have an
answer, just doesn't matter. So just as long as it works and it's all relatively
smooth like last year and the year before and the year before, it's totally a non-factor. I have actually literally
handed 120 hertz phone to people next to a 60 hertz phone, and even side by side next to each other, they can't see the difference. Or if they do, it's just like, oh, that's a subtle thing
that seems kind of neat but they'd be totally
fine missing out on it. So with the target
demographic of this phone, it's totally fine. But on the other hand, Apple, the richest technology
company in the world, does stuff all the time that regular people will
literally never notice, that are subtle improvements
or changes here and there, all the time. Like, when they switched
these baseline iPhones from LCD to OLED displays, do you think any of these
people actually noticed that? Or what about going from
the A15 Bionic last year to this A16 Bionic? Do you think people are actually noticing the differences here? Or what about when they
just added 5G to the iPhone and most people didn't care? Like, making subtle improvements over time is what modern smartphones
are all about these days. And I would actually argue that a higher refresh rate is more noticeable to more people than some
of those other things. Like, I think you could today
hand me, a professional, an unlabeled iPhone with an
A15 Bionic and an A16 Bionic, and it would take me quite some time to find the real differences between them. And so, that combined with the fact that it's incredibly cheap
and easy and reasonable to get to like at least a 90 hertz phone, isn't the new Moto G is
like 90 hertz at $170 or something like that? Now I'm sure that's a
horrible looking screen compared to this iPhone, it's 720P with the brightness
of a box of crayons. But still they decided
to add that to that phone because Motorola knew that
enough people would notice it and feel that smoothness difference and it's a higher level
of perceived performance. So it's just wild to me, knowing how easy it would
be for Apple to make this even a 90 hertz display, but
they just refuse to do it because they've attached the
word Pro to that feature. It's promotion for the Pro phones. And it just strikes me as a tool just to sort of continue widening the gap as much as they can
between the Pro iPhones and the non-Pro iPhones,
and they're happy to do it, even if it makes this iPhone 15 the most expensive phone in the world with a 60 hertz display. Anyway, speaking of widening that gap, the Pro phones this year also
got a brand new A17 Pro chip but this iPhone 15 gets
last year's A16 Bionic from the 14 Pro. Honestly, the renaming of the Pro chip might be the most interesting part because it implies that it's definitely not going to trickle down to the baseline phone next year. But either way, this A16 bionic here is more than good enough
in a phone of this price, as far as performance and
handling everyday tasks and gaming and flying
around iOS at 60 hertz. And the one thing you definitely
can argue for 60 hertz would be battery life, because despite all the
issues floating around, the battery life on these
phones has been pretty good. So I don't know if you saw it, but Apple has officially now addressed the heat and battery
issues that some people, including myself, have been
reporting with these iPhones. So an iOS update is coming and it seems like some
specific third party apps, like Instagram, were also having issues and those should be getting updates too. But on average, the battery life on my 15 has been better than my
battery on the 15 Pro. And the 15 Plus looks to have the best battery life ever on any iPhone, which is really promising. So that combination of the
A16 Bionic, which is not new, and 60 hertz screens, which are not new, are giving you great battery life. Also, USB-C is definitely not new but here it is alongside all
the benefits that come with it, from using the same cable
to charge everything, to plugging into more accessories, like monitors and keyboards
and all kinds of other stuff. It is sad that the older chip does mean there's no USB 3 controller so there are no USB 3 data
speeds, it's still slow, but honestly, unless you're using the Pro iPhone's camera features, there's almost nobody
here buying this phone that's gonna actually need
fast data transfer anyway so I guess you can give it a pass. And they managed to do
it in the Apple way too. They color matched the
inside of the USB-C port with the color of the
phone, and they actually, I don't know if you've seen this, they print the model
number inside the port. So Apple really loves hiding this in the most discreet way possible. You know, I should really
gives some appreciation to some of the clever software
features on the iPhone 15 because you could actually
consider them new. So they added stuff like
an ultra-wideband chip so you can find your phone
more easily with an Apple Watch or be found on Find My
Friends, that's new. They also added these clever audio effects and video effects at an OS level, so they work inside of any app. So you can be on a phone
call or a video call or a Google Meet or Zoom or whatever, and flip on the background
noise cancellation and it works really shockingly well, it's very, very good. So I'm on a phone call with myself, this is what it'll sound
like to be in a room with the dishwasher
running, the HVAC going, and the sink going right next to me, right next to the microphone. When I switch the mic from Standard mode to Voice Isolation mode, even though all the same
noises are still happening, it does a much better
job of just picking out specifically my voice, really smart and it's genuinely new. There's also some other not so new stuff, like they just now added
downloadable offline areas to Apple Maps and interactable widgets, and they finally added an
80% battery charge limiter in the settings. So you can check out all this stuff, I did a full video on the iOS 17 update at the link below that like button, if you wanna watch that, you
should definitely check it out after you watch this video. What I will say is one of
the most liked features I talked about in that
video is Standby mode. And on the Pro iPhone, when
you put it on a charger, turn it sideways, it keeps the screen on which it can do because
it goes to one Hertz, it's an LTPO display, and it's
fine staying on like that. But on the non-Pro iPhone,
which does not have LTPO, it's basically locked at I
think either 30 or 60 hertz, either way it doesn't drop to one Hertz. So Apple just decides, we'll turn off the screen
after a little bit, which kind of feels like it defeats the purpose of this feature, so then you have to nudge the
table or or bump the stand to wake it up like an Apple Watch charger. Just a notable difference between the Pro and non-Pro iPhones. But last but not least, these new cameras are actually
weird, but in a good way. So iPhone 15 has been upgraded to a new set of 12 megapixel ultra wide and the new 48 megapixel main camera. It's not the same sensor as the Pro, it's actually slightly smaller, but it has a larger max aperture
of F1.6 to make up for it. And then, it's also
doing a combo of binning and detailed transfer to give you this new 24 megapixel photo
as a result by default. Now, if you were paying attention before, you'll remember that this new iPhone has the exact same chip
as last year's Pro iPhone. Same processing cores, same
image signal processor, same neural engine, same
A16 Bionic, same everything. So why is this new 24 megapixel default only coming to the newest iPhone
15 and not last year's Pro? Like, I still have last year's Pro phone and I've updated it to the latest software and it does not get this feature, it's still shooting 12 megapixels. So honestly now my base iPhone
15's non-zoomed in photos are actually looking a little better, a little more detailed than
last year's Pro phones. And then, there's the new auto-Portrait Mode detection
feature, which is pretty sweet. Basically you don't have
to switch to Portrait Mode to take a photo that captures
all of the depth information that allows you to turn it into
a Portrait Mode photo later. So as long as you're pointing
the camera at a human subject or a cat or a dog as identified
by the neural engine, or if you tap to focus, you
automatically get this little F at the bottom corner of the screen, which means it's capturing the data needed for Portrait Mode, just in case. And so, then, later, if you decide, eh, I actually do want this
to be a Portrait Mode shot, you go into your gallery and just make it a Portrait Mode photo, that you can even then go
in and edit and play with. Some people have been describing it as being able to change
the focus point later. It's not exactly doing that, you can't like save something that was out of focus by bringing it back. But basically, for the classic iPhone shot where it kind of looks like
everything is in focus, then, yeah, you can
play with Portrait Mode and get really good results. Last year's Pro iPhone has the same chip, also has a 48 megapixel main camera and has the same neural engine, doesn't get this feature, for some reason. Also kind of weird. So look, with these reviews, we always make a lot of judgements about what we think the
typical iPhone buyer is, what they actually care
about, what they'll notice, what they will appreciate
about a new phone. And with this one, I do
feel like they've stacked up enough of these subtle improvements, that even though it looks the same and there's not really that
much that's actually new here, they've at least stacked enough things that it feels like an
appreciably better phone. So my verdict is, if
you have an iPhone 14, you don't have to upgrade,
of course, even a 13 maybe. But if you have an older phone and you're looking to
upgrade to a new iPhone, every year, I always
get friends asking like, ""Oh, should I just get the older, like last year's iPhone
to save some money?"" And no, I actually wouldn't, I would say just get the iPhone 15. There's enough new changes here, it's a better phone in
every way and it's also USB. Like, you don't buy a base iPhone to get the bleeding edge of tech, you buy it just 'cause
it works and it's fine and it's gonna be familiar and
work for the next few years. And just knowing that you're gonna have it for the next few years, I would not recommend
buying a Lightning iPhone as we just moved everything forward into the world of USB type C. Just get the new one, just
grab the boring new iPhone with nothing that's actually that new. It's just gonna work. That's it, thanks for watching,
catch you in the next one. Peace. (upbeat music) "
18,mfbSqTB74xM,Google Pixel 4 Review: Inside the Hype Machine!,2019-10-22T01:52:18Z,"{'viewCount': '5739057', 'likeCount': '119210', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '11201'}",[Music] hey what is up guys mkbhd here this is the pixel 4 xl this is one of the phones i was looking forward to the most this entire year for 2019 for a couple of reasons and so now i've been using it daily since it's unveiling this is my honest review so let's just start with the way it looks i honestly think it's a pretty decent looking phone it's low-key really clean there's almost no markings along the back just the google g at the bottom matte black aluminum rails as part of the design all the way around the phone speaker slots at the bottom lined up with the usb type-c port and the colored power button of course on every version and the whole back of the phone on two of the colors is this soft touch matte finish which does a great job of not showing fingerprints it doesn't seem to scratch very easily at all so of the three colors available i'm gonna say this white this panda version is the best one that power button is pretty sweet then i'm going to say oh so orange is in second place not so great power button but at least it's matte and then that jet black weirdly very glossy version is in third place fun fact though since the rails are still matte black you can slap a matte black dbrand skin on the back of any of these phones and you just created the matte black everything phone google should have made in the first place so link to that below and of course shout out to dbrand for sponsoring this video the pixel square camera bump is again annoyingly a little bit raised but i don't find this as drastic as say apple's larger double raised triple camera bump but more on the cameras later so yeah you know what generally it's grown on me pretty decent looking phone i was though let a little bit down by the not super clicky buttons just the volume ones mainly but on the other hand something a lot of people have missed that's good to know the phone is now ip68 water resistant it still has the squeeze sensitivity for the assistant and it still has stereo speakers so they're not front-facing pair like they were last year but they are still a good sounding solid pair with the slots at the bottom and the earpiece speaker combined uh the worst part about the way this phone looks is the front the part you look at most of the time i'm not a fan of the forehead it has a smaller chin at the bottom than before but yeah that big forehead i don't like it i'm still kind of barely getting used to it and overall the reason for the forehead doesn't really have me convinced so there's a cluster of new sensors up here in the top including the selfie camera then also infrared projector receiver and radar which is new in any smartphone and this new sensor suite up here is good for two things the fastest face unlock in any smartphone and some gestures okay maybe it makes me a little not forward thinking but i still like fingerprint sensors and this phone has none of that the face unlock is the only biometric unlock this phone has and i find myself missing a fingerprint sensor and the rate of improvement for fingerprint sensors under the glass has been pretty good so that move was not my favorite pixel 4 uses a radar sensor to essentially project a little bubble around the phone to see when things are near it when things are in the bubble when they enter it exit it etc so when you reach for your phone basically your hand enters the bubble and it starts firing up the infrared and face unlock sensors early so by the time you pick the phone up it's already reading your face and logging you in and it's incredibly fast over and over again it's super impressive possibly too fast this kind of reminds me of the oneplus 6 and other phones that would just do face unlock with just the rgb cameras so they'd be insanely fast they would just see anything that looks like you and just unlock as soon as you glance at it so this isn't that it's still infrared so it still can't be fooled by a photo or video of you it still works in the dark and things like that so it's got advantages but it's still a little bit wild i find myself just unlocking this phone left and right all the time anytime i even just look at it sometimes i pick up the phone just to move it across my desk and i'll just glance at the time and it unlocks the phone it also doesn't require your attention so it will unlock with your eyes closed that's uh that's a bit of a weird security quirk and it actually even tells you it'll do this in the settings when you turn this on it says looking at the phone can unlock it when you don't intend it to and your device can be unlocked by someone even if it's held up to your face even if your eyes are closed and potentially could be unlocked by someone who just looks a lot like you these are things that could potentially be fixed or improved with a software update and google's been pretty good about software updates but as of right now they're just pretty annoying my solution is turn off the skip lock screen option so if i do accidentally unlock it at least it won't be awake for a while it just sits on the lock screen and then it'll go back to sleep but yeah i mean that's what i think i mean when i say i would have liked a fingerprint reader option it's a little safer we're a little more used to it and it just sort of works when we need it and doesn't when we don't so that's face unlock but then these sensors also enable a couple very specific gestures so anytime you're in a situation you can wave over your phone and use the gesture the status bar sort of lights up it starts glowing and that means it's ready so those situations are alarm clocks timers media controls and a pikachu live wallpaper and there are no instructions like really built into android there's none in the android 10 setup for example nothing really tells you what's going on when you first get that glowing bar you just kind of have to know so when an alarm or a timer is going off as your hand enters that radar bubble it quiets the alarm and then you can dismiss it by tapping or swiping away over the phone that for me was my favorite it worked really well i can sleep with my phone on this pixel stand next to the bed and when the alarm goes off i just reach for it and it's already quieting down the other thing that was less consistent for me is music apps so if you're in spotify or google play music or any supported app where that glowing bar starts showing up you can swipe forward and swipe back through previous and next tracks and yeah that's it just forward and backwards when i first tried this at the event i was getting a success rate of like 10 percent i'm not even exaggerating like it was pretty abysmal now with some troubleshooting and practice and some tips from twitter i'd say i'm up to like a 70 swipe success rate maybe 75 so it's less of like a big arm movement although that sometimes does work but it's more of like a casual swipe and not too close to the phone like right around where that radar bubble might be i think the real problem is it doesn't show you or tell you how to do it better the made by google twitter account they tweeted at me saying you can go to the pixel tips app which is pre-installed on the pixel click save time and then click try it and then there you will find a demo if you want to practice it but even then there isn't actually i tried it there isn't actually any feedback it's just letting you practice so all of that being said i'm still not going to use these i it sort of falls in that same gimmick bucket as the g8s weird hover hand swiping action if it told me how to do it better maybe i'd be more into it but yeah not going to use these if there's anything to love about the front of this phone it's the new display pixel 4 and pixel 4 xl have made the jump to smooth high-res high-refresh rate 90 hertz displays my favorite trend in smartphones of the past year so it's difficult to show you exactly how much better that looks obviously i keep saying on camera because this is a 30fps video you know the correct frame rate but in person it makes a huge difference and every time a new phone comes out with a 90 hertz or higher display i can see a serious difference versus 60 hertz it comes with some trade-offs though it's not the brightest display sometimes daytime visibility is pretty weak unfortunately so i'm keeping this phone at max brightness often and high refresh rate also requires more power so you're going to see a hit on battery life now initially i was we're all concerned about the battery life on pixel 4 knowing it has a higher fresh rate and then the xl having a 3 700 milliamp hour battery and the smaller pixel 4 having a 2 800 milliamp hour battery that's one of the smallest i've seen in a phone in a while but impressively these phones have had for me okay battery life but there's a big reason for that i was briefly messaging dave2d who's he's testing this smaller pixel 4 and he said he's getting around five hours of screen on time which if i take his word for it that's actually pretty impressive um for me i've been getting around five hours on this xl on 90 hertz which you know that's c plus which is a lot better than the f i thought it could be turns out the reason this phone has been able to get even okay battery life is because it ratchets down to 60 hertz constantly all the time it's supposed to be smart about it so it says when you turn on smooth display that it'll turn back down to 60 hertz when you're not looking at it or you're not using it much and then ratchet it back up to 90 when you're swiping or you see animations and stuff but i found often it just stays at 60 hertz for extended periods of time for no apparent reason it almost seemed like it was defaulting to 60 hertz most of the time and then sometimes bumping up to 90 hertz for scrolling and some other things i started to not like it i started to find that this phone felt significantly choppier like any other 60hz phone than say the oneplus 7 pro which seems like it's almost always at 90 hertz so i was like okay this isn't great it's not my favorite implementation of 90 hertz it's smooth sometimes but it's almost like a tease that it switches back and forth so much so i'm like digging around in developer options just to see if there's anything new and there is i found an option that i'd never seen before it's called force 90 hertz and it just keeps the display at 90 hertz all the time no matter what's happening on the screen closer to what oneplus does and it's made a huge difference now it's always smooth so i guess pro tip if you're one of those people who's more of a power user and uses their phone all the time and wants to see that 90 hertz happen you can go in the developer settings scroll down find force 90 hertz and turn it on it will obliterate your battery life it's definitely even worse now closer to a d it's not lasting all day um but at least it's smoother now anyway i also found that it has ambient eq which is supposed to be auto adjusting the color temperature depending on the light around you kind of like apple's true tone on the iphone but i found it much more subtle so i just left it off it's not nearly as dramatic and overall it's just it's not the flashiest or most eye-catching or dramatic display on any smartphone it doesn't curve over the edges or anything but it's 90 hertz it's 1440p it's oled and it's flat but listen we all know what the pixel 4 is about it's what the pixel 3 was about and it's what the pixel 2 is about it's the cameras and we got some new cameras on the back of the pixel 4. there's dual cameras back here it's a 12 megapixel primary camera and a new 16 megapixel 2x telephoto camera um okay if you told me the pixel 4 would have the first second camera of any pixel phone and asked me what would be the most useless second camera they could put in the pixel right behind like a black and white depth sensor or a time-of-flight camera i would have put like a 2x telephoto lens just behind like an ultra wide clearly being way more fun or a 3 or a 5x telephoto or any of that other stuff but that's what we got we got 2x telephoto but you know what specs are just one thing i gotta actually use it in person that's what i've been doing maybe it'll change my mind yeah it didn't really change my mind typical photos from the pixel 4 are very similar to pixel 3. great dynamic range great sharpness and detail very contrasty and punchy and dramatic and biasing a little bit towards cooler tones typically if anything but they're excellent photos they've got this image processing pipeline and their hdr down to a science and that didn't shock anyone thankfully so that's good and the improvements in the viewfinder are cool too you now have real-time approximation of the hdr effect you're going to get applied before you even snap the photo so there's no guessing you can pretty much just see what the final photo is going to look like as you're taking it plus there's new sliders for exposure and shadow adjustment that can be really cool and you can mess with if you want but then having a second lens should mean portrait photos are better now because you have two lenses and you can finally do depth data between them i found that they're about the same matter of fact some of the ones i took of mac here look worse than any i ever took on the pixel 3. just look at that cutout failure that's pretty terrible maybe i shouldn't depend on pet photos for my testing and portrait mode but i'm not exactly convinced by that but generally on photos of people it's doing about the same job with that aggressive cutout and then speaking of portrait mode you actually can't do wide portrait photos anymore which the pixel 3 took some of the best wide portrait photos but it gets even more double weird when you actually look into it so pixel 3 took some pretty great portraits with one wide camera right when you switch to portrait mode on the pixel 4 it automatically zooms in but not quite to 2x to about 1.7 or 1.8 x but then it doesn't let you zoom out and take wide portrait photos like the iphone does but as i'm messing with this i realize if i cover the telephoto camera while i'm in portrait mode nothing happens it's still using the main camera for portrait mode photos it's just using the second camera for depth approximation so why does it zoom in i have no answer for that so basically the best thing about having a telephoto camera is for zoomed in photos i don't take a lot of zoomed in photos but i did notice them higher quality so if you're someone who likes to go 6 8x zoomed in you'll appreciate the better super resume there you go anyway the question still is is this the best camera in any smartphone uh because i think we can all agree pixel 3 was top of the stack last year but now the field is catching up especially iphone 11 pro so which is better okay honestly in daylight for most photos i prefer pixel photos i definitely like that contrasty punchy detailed look same with wide angle selfies punchy detailed i'm a fan in lower light though i actually start to prefer iphone photos and i know the pixel you know just got astrophotography capabilities that are really cool and night sight has always been great for well over a year now but they get a little more dramatic and as a result a little more noisy and iphone's new night mode and deep fusion i think stay truer to life and as a result better in quality fun fact i actually did a collab that's live now with supersaf in one of his legendary side by side photo comparisons so that's the best way to see the differences between the two so you can see iphone 11 pro versus pixel 4 side by side in all of our glory i'll leave a link below to that so is this the best camera in any smartphone sometimes i'm going to say it's a toss-up depending on the scenario and that's not a cop-out i gave my reasons um but if i could only pick one which is sort of a different question i would pick iphone 11 pro because it's more versatile it has the ultra wide and it absolutely crushes it in video like video is just not as much of a focus with the pixel 4's camera anymore no pun intended it tops out at 4k 30fps which google tweeted is because it would basically take up too much storage but then like you could have still enabled it in settings if you really cared right and that also doesn't explain why it doesn't have 24fps video which would have been a cool addition and it also tops out at 1080p from the front-facing wide camera so just generally if you're in it for video you shouldn't be looking at pixel you should be looking at iphone 11 pro my pixel versus iphone camera graph is like this pair of lines where the middle is where most photos are taken most of the time and that's where i prefer pixel but on the edges of photography like low light or ultra wide then the iphone does better so there hopefully that explanation makes sense and then you can't forget android 10 which gets the special treatment on the pixel since it's google's baby there are some good features here that add to how smart it is as a smartphone you already heard about the radar bubble and the smart unlock features they move the text-to-speech offline local on the phone so text-to-speech is way faster and way more consistent i love that you can talk as fast as you want and it just works and there's a new voice recorder app that takes advantage of that to live transcribe everything you say and then indexes that text to make it searchable that's like an s pen level feature i personally probably won't use it too much but i can see how people who use that would find it a really big deal but yeah the best part of the pixel again is how refined android is if you want the latest version of android if you want to be first with updates if you want the coolest edge features and the assistant and all that is the phone to get so overall many of the conclusions about pixel 4 are of course about how disappointing it is which i think is an easy conclusion to reach if you followed all the leaks and nothing really surprised you and there are things that are let down i personally really enjoyed using pixel because of the punchy confident excellent camera for still photos and the 90 hertz display which a lot of phones don't have yet and of course the extra ram finally a smooth pixel phone but this isn't a phone i'm going to go around recommending to everyone it still needs a bigger battery still needs more storage and it's just generally not complete for most people so i guess if you're like me which is in a tiny group of people who really like high refresh rate screens of course value the camera and want the latest version of android and these quick updates and things like that and you're willing to overpay because we all know the pixel is a bit overpriced for the storage you don't get then sure i recommend the pixel it's great for people like that but for most people i'm not going to end up recommending the pixel 4 mainly because of the battery but also because there are just better deals out there right now including the cheaper iphone 11 weird to save but it kind of hits the ear funny but it's true so there you have it the pixel 4 possibly a victim of the hype machine of being the most leaked phone of all time i kind of wouldn't be surprised if it happens again next year but either way now you know what it's like to own it and i'm curious are you in this tiny group of people who would like this pixel experience let me know either way thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music] 
19,NBLO6RpofIU,Google Pixel 5 Review: Software Special!,2020-10-23T21:04:52Z,"{'viewCount': '4649451', 'likeCount': '148351', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '8443'}",[Music] hey what's up mkbhd here pixel 5 google pixel 5. you know if you think about it it's actually kind of funny that google makes smartphones just because you know you and me both know google as a software company and an ads company but we really know their specialty is software yet every year we have these huge expectations like they're going to blow our minds with some amazing pixel hardware but they never do they never really do because pixel hardware has never actually been that great they've never had the best screens or the best designs they've never had the biggest sensors or the most ram pixel has never really been about that so now it just seems that 2020 is the year google not just recognizes that but embraces that the pixel is all about the software so they're not even making a thousand dollar crazy high-end flagship hardware phone this year that i'm gonna try the pixel 5 is 6.99 and it's just a vessel for all the best software that google makes and the result is a pretty nice phone it's a pretty nice phone not some mind blowing bleeding edge hard ass phone just a nice phone this metal build losing those hardware bells and whistles from last year i actually think made it better to be honest so no radar system up in the top in the huge bezel for some flashy gestures i'll never use and face unlock instead just a selfie camera cut out all screen up on the front of this phone thin symmetrical bezels like i said it's not a stretch to say this is the best looking front of a pixel ever just by keeping it simple the back material we kept getting told by google that it's metal right and it is but then that metal is underneath a coating of this kind of soft touch textured plastic it seems like it's wearing well it doesn't have any staining problems or anything like that except the power button is still glossy that's a little different from the rest of the body but yeah the result is this pretty clean and well-built design no seams i've seen some headlines of people getting pixels that weirdly have the back slightly detached like separated from the front glass piece here super odd but clearly mine doesn't have that issue at all it's water resistant which is awesome there's a classic fast reliable fingerprint reader back here that can double as a notification shade pull down if you're into that and then there's a cut out in the back for wireless charging which is clever but overall pretty understated i would say the phone is small it's a six inch edge to edge display but it's small it's smaller than the iphone 12 smaller than a lot of other flagships and i think a lot of people appreciate that and i don't know what it is about this green tech all this green stuff coming out but yeah green's not really my color i would probably do the other color which is black or big brain status you can grab a case from channel sponsor dbrand and pick any color you want and they've actually been refining their materials on this grip case which has this new texture along the sides with literally tens of thousands of these tiny little micro dots on the surface to give you more grip so it kind of feels like a tame version of that old one plus sandstone so if you want to get a grip link will be below that like button as always so okay they definitely took a step back from the the premium hardware of previous years even on the inside the vibration motor in this phone has taken a step down it's a very standard kind of sloppy feeling regular vibration motor no headphone jack no earpiece speaker too so the stereo image from this speaker pair is a little bit weaker all of which would normally be really disappointing in a sequel to a flagship but i guess you can't really look at this phone as a sequel to a flagship it's a different price point it's 6.99 so it's actually not really shocking at all the display on the front is par for the course it's a six inch diagonal 1080p 90hz oled and with a pretty nice colors and a decent max brightness it's not you know quite the eye searingly bright for outdoor visibility that the flagships are but it's good enough for everything else and i'll go back to the overall aesthetic these bezels are thin all the way around even through the corners and most people including me are just going to really like this display but and it hurts me to say this i can tell the difference between this 90 hertz display and some of the 120 hertz displays in some other phones in this price range now again most people won't and it's kind of fair to point that out but this is my review and you would want to know the things that i noticed so this is something i'm noticing and if you care about this type of stuff you'd want to know that you can see the difference so now you know phones like the oneplus 8t and the galaxy s20 fan edition feel to me noticeably smoother than this phone now this phone is also trying to throttle down from 90 hertz all the time and you might have to force 90 hertz to keep it at 90 hertz but generally if you'd want to know that now you know but most people won't have any problem with this 90hz display also there aren't very many snapdragon 765g phones at 120 hertz so this setup really is more balanced between performance and efficiency and this phone this phone never really felt slow which is good it just never felt quite as fast as 120hz flagship to my calibrated eye and i think that's actually more because of the display than the chip so a lot of people got mad because pixel was going down to a snapdragon 765g which is technically a weaker performer on paper than the one in the phone that came before it how could they do that but i actually think this was a great idea for the efficiency gains and this is actually a performance difference that i think no one including myself would actually notice so when you combine this chip and eight gigs of ram with google's software wizardry you get a phone that feels just fine in everyday use and performance and even through gaming and a battery life that's actually mind-blowing i failed to kill this phone in a day every single day for two weeks now i realize this is quarantine life and i'm not in a 5g area so um this isn't the hardest possible use that this phone will ever see but the fact that i'm ending a lot of days with four hours of screen on time and 50 battery left to me says this battery is pretty much good to last all day for anyone even forcing 90 hertz in the developer settings like i mentioned earlier didn't kill this phone much faster keeping the screen on as often as possible didn't kill this phone in a day i'm telling you through gaming and watching videos and navigation and multitasking like this has been the most pleasantly surprising battery experience in a phone in a while it just sips power but okay you know how cameras have always been the focus of the pixel line ever since that pixel 2 leapfrogged everything well this camera this camera is the maximum proof of google's software over everything approach this camera uses the same sensor as that pixel 2. so since then sensors have clearly gotten way bigger and higher resolution and apertures have gotten wider and hardware tech has advanced a lot but google has stuck with their software special of maximizing not that amazing hardware plus they went ahead and added an ultra wide this year which is great so yes i'm just going to say pixel 5 takes in my opinion still the best looking photos of any smartphone they still nail the look because they haven't changed it it's confident it's a contrasty look with great detail and dynamic range definitely my favorite look but the lead the pixel camera used to have over the rest of the crowd has narrowed a lot and honestly other other smartphone cameras can do things just as well sometimes better with better hardware better natural blur from bigger sensors better detail from higher resolution 50 64 100 megapixel sensors so it makes me wonder how much longer google can keep sticking to this formula i know mr mobile in his video on the pixel 5 he compared the note 20 ultra versus the pixel 5 at night and of course at night you get some interesting observations about how a bigger sensor gathers way more light and can create real depth instead of having to fake it with software so really good video i'll link his review below but yeah bottom line pixel 5 camera is really really good but i kind of wonder how much longer this setup will have at the top before the hardware work passes it knowing google and their tendency to lean on software maybe they'll stick with it a little too long the software is just still so killer though i love the exposure and contrast adjustment sliders that are still here also there's these little alignment tricks for the horizon and for it to take perfectly flat top down shots uh there's portrait lighting and portrait light editing inside of google photos which is crazy i've never seen it before but it it works really well and you've got night sight night sight selfies night sight portrait mode i like that it suggests portrait mode now when it recognizes a person as a subject and the automatic night side switching at nighttime when it detects a dark scene it's all basically software magic some of it takes a little bit longer to process though since there's no dedicated image processor anymore so it takes a few seconds after snapping an image for the 765g to actually process it free to view it and that doesn't feel as premium when you have to wait for your photo but the weight is clearly worth it and hey all the android 11 features all the pixel features you could possibly want are also here in this phone minus squeeze for assistant but i think that's because of the metal build they got rid of that but google doesn't have to hold back any software experiences to protect their higher end more expensive phones from cutting sales from them because this is their highest end most expensive phone so they get everything so the call screen feature from last year is still great the recorder app with live transcription and search still super useful the live captioning of any and all audio going through the phone like videos are watching or music lyrics or phone calls and there's also some new stuff like the new wallpaper picker preview in android 11 and making google assistant wait on hold for you which i haven't gotten to work yet but sounds like something google would figure out how to do so the pixel like the nexus that came before it and even the google play edition stuff has has always been some of my favorite android experiences and there's just something about it but this one's no different it's an aesthetic it's a feeling it's a look and the bonus is you get to be right at the front of the line for whatever stuff ends up in the newest versions of android down the road so at the end of the day is the pixel 5 is this a good phone well here's my take yeah pixel 5 is a good phone this is a good device i think there's an argument you could make that it should have been like 5.99 instead of 6.99 and i honestly wouldn't be surprised to see it on sale for that on black friday and even after that this year but it's a good phone and also for those who haven't been paying as much attention the pixel 4a 5g is a very similar also good phone for a lot of the same reasons for 4.99 so i'm going to link that below also but for those wondering about me and am i going to make the pixel 5 my new daily driver this is the opposite of a normal caveat you've heard me say before it's not for everyone i you guys already know i like high quality cameras i like great performance i like stock android you would think that the pixel would be for me but i wish they had made a high-end flagship version that goes the extra mile with hardware and some bells and whistles even knowing it wouldn't sell that much i wish they had made a version with the neural core so that image processing is a little faster i wish they'd made a version with the snapdragon 865 and 12 gigs of ram so performance is good for longer i wish they'd made a version with 120hz display so it feels snappy all the time the battery can clearly handle it i wish they'd made a version that's a little bigger it's just a lot of little stuff that i'm so used to on flagships that this phone doesn't have that i'm i feel like i'm missing now so they decided to make a mid-range phone which let's be honest was a pretty smart idea for them but uh for me personally i'm going to be going back to a higher end phone i think just because that's what i'm used to so for those wondering about me that's me but if you're ever looking for a master class on how to use great software to turn a pretty good smartphone into a really good smartphone you're looking at it the pixel 5 that's what pixel has been all about for so long it's just them finally embracing it and i'm glad to see it so well played google thanks for watching catch you guys the next one [Music] peace 
20,9hvjBi4PKWA,Pixel 6/6 Pro Review: Almost Incredible!,2021-10-27T22:17:45Z,"{'viewCount': '7826502', 'likeCount': '241428', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '14999'}",[Music] so [Music] hey what's up mkbhd here and i've been using pixel 6 and pixel 6 pro for about three weeks now this is it this is the first year we're expecting a real google flagship right so previous pixels have been pretty nice and they've had great cameras and pretty cool software features but overall pretty lackluster hardware but this is a step up we're expecting big things a big new camera array a new design language they made their own chip there's a lot going for it so this is their moon shot right this is their chance to compete with the big dogs so now that i've used them i will say these are my favorite pixels ever and they are the most google phones ever made for sure but reality check they're not perfect and there's definitely some areas where they come up a little bit short so i'm going to go over those things but off the top i just want to hit you with the prices first okay so 5.99 for pixel 6 starting and 8.99 for the pixel 6 pro those are both at 128 gigs that's really competitive so there's a lot of action already at that like 599 dollar price range but also the one they keep calling a flagship which is the six pro this is the one that's here to take shots at the iphones and samsung galaxy s21 ultras of the world and it competes but the six is the real deal so i've grown to really like this camera bar design for the pixels and the fact is it is polarizing like it doesn't look quite like any other phone theoretically you know the huge new camera sensors need all this thickness here but it could have looked like any other phone like the vivo x70 pro plus has the same 50 megapixel sensor but they went with a camera rectangle but this visor it's a look this is the uh the pixel phone look now it's very easily recognizable and i think that's on purpose and they can keep it this way for at least a few years and the bar design is functional i will say my index finger does end up resting nicely underneath the camera bar when i'm holding it which is nice it doesn't rock on a table either if you're typing or using it out of your hand the only weird part is it doesn't quite like blend nicely into the aluminum sides of this phone like i think it would have been really cool if it was like a seamless blend like one piece like what samsung did with the s21 ultra but there are a lot of seams all over this camera module but hey at the end of the day if you're just going to toss the case on it like this grip case from channel sponsor dbrand it's basically just going to cancel the bump anyway but now you've got you know a flat even phone you've got your icons logos but it's still obviously a pixel underneath that you still have the visor across the back so i think it's a win unless you think it's incredibly ugly in which case try not to look at the back of the phone too much but come on visors look cool but the part you look at on the front of the phone is huge on both screens both of these phones are huge and i think the the question naturally is why didn't they make a smaller one and i think google's answer would be well there are people who want to spend less on a phone but most of those people still want a big screen so they gave it to him so pixel 6's screen is a pretty massive 6.4 inches from corner to corner 90 hertz 1080p and flat and with pretty small bezels overall and a hole punch in the top middle for the selfie camera it's a pretty good screen again for a 600 phone but how about that flagship though so with the 6 pro we're looking at 6.7 inches 1440p and up to 120 hertz it is super super sharp very responsive and has been an absolute pleasure but since they're saying it's the flagship i can get a little more nitpicky here these curved edges they're kind of going out of style i know that gets you even smaller bezels and they are a little bit smaller but the fact that it gets kind of a bit darker in the very corners isn't doing the screen any favors and there also is a little bit of color shift off axis that you really straight up just don't see on the more expensive screens like on the s21 ultra or the iphone 13 pro also the fingerprint reader on the display of both of these phones is kind of slow so it appears to be an optical sensor shining a light on your finger instead of those new ultrasonic ones samsung is using and yeah it's gotten kind of annoying after a while often it will take a full like half second at least long enough for me to get annoyed that i'm waiting for it to read my finger i think they could have used a better sensor here or at least done this a little faster i am comparing it to thousand dollar phones though so again this is what i was talking about earlier it's impressive that it's hanging with the big dogs but it is just undercutting it a little bit now the top hole punch in the middle of these displays houses the selfie camera it's a pretty decent 8 megapixel wide camera on the pixel 6 but it's closer to an ultra wide selfie on the 6 pro which i really like a lot and it's also bumped up to 11 megapixels so it can also shoot 4k selfie video fits more people on the frame big fan of the six pros selfie camera and then also you know the little things that you'd sort of expect a great phone to do well but that you don't want to have to think about too much like clicky buttons check both phones are fully water resistant and the haptics are really good on both phones as well so that's a pixel thing but the biggest new piece google's adding to these phones is definitely on the inside and that would be the new tensor chip so designed by google for this phone this is going to let them do in theory things that they couldn't do with the off-the-shelf qualcomm chip they'd used before you know machine learning better ai better computational photography all kinds of things they want to focus on with just this phone they can do it and it's done that it's really impressive now a lot of people are wondering how tensor would benchmark just and i don't think that's the right way to think about this new chip but just out of curiosity i threw a geekbench at it and we have the numbers it got 1035 on single core 2800 multi-core so that's maybe 8 to 10 slower with the cpu on paper than the snapdragon triple eight but also still way way ahead of the snapdragon 765 g they used on the pixel five last year but then also i did uh some gpu benchmarks from 3dmark and it was looking at 10 to 12 faster than the snapdragon triple a but that's clearly not what tensor is about this this might be the biggest this is what makes it a googly phone this is the biggest difference between the benchmarks and what the phone is actually capable of that i've ever seen so first of all these phones have been really quick and responsive no performance problems for me i've mostly been dailying the 6 pro which has got the adaptive refresh rate up to 120 hertz and i've been loving that but it's not about the performance as much as it's about the features and this continues a tradition of the pixel phone being the smartest smartphone to come out every year so you know besides the stuff we've already seen like call screening where google assistants can filter incoming calls for you or now playing which ambiently detects whatever song is playing in the background in your environment and just keeps a running list so you can remember what song was going on in the background in the grocery store an hour ago and we've seen live captioning of any and all videos and phone calls and movies in real time besides all of that there is some new improved stuff thanks to tensor and dedicated pieces of that ship so first of all speech to text unreal on this phone absolutely incredible to the point where it actually changes the way i use the phone i try to use voice more often on this phone because it's so good so anywhere i'd normally be typing i use that mic button anywhere i can and no matter how fast you talk you can basically rap at it you can talk 200 words per minute like eminem if you want to and it'll just keep going quick it also adds punctuation really accurately so you don't really even have to think about that you're just automatically grammatically accurate all the time this is going to make sitting in lectures and people in class taking notes way less stressed and basically anywhere else transcription is useful and even on top of all that it's smart so if you say a name it will pull from the names in your contacts try to make sure it spells it right if there's multiple different spellings of names for something and you correct it once it will remember that corrected spelling of a name things like that if you say delete this or send it doesn't type those words it knows what you're trying to do and will actually delete the words or send the message now there's also a new feature in google photos for pixel six that lets you go back to any picture in your library and erase the things that you don't want now this isn't blowing your mind if you've seen content aware phil on photoshop before but i'm mostly really impressed with how easy and simple it makes the process so you go into any image go to tools and it's called magic eraser and it automatically selects what it thinks you want to remove usually a background photo bomber of some sort and then you can just do it and if there's other stuff you want to remove you can draw a sloppy outline around it it will auto detect the edges usually really well with any sort of contrast finds the object you're talking about and just removes it just like that so it kind of reads like magic and people on twitter loved it but just like photoshop's content aware feel it has certain things it works really well on and other things not so much so it works best with simple repeating backgrounds you know maybe gradients or textures and with a lot of contrast but if you try to get rid of like a large object that's in front of several different backgrounds well that's just gonna look bad like that's difficult for ai but i was very impressed with some of the things that pulled off just messing around with it it's probably a gimmick feature still for most people but this is yet another demo of the powerful ai and tensor that can be pretty great sometimes now something i thought would be better with tensor is battery life and you know maybe i was getting my hopes up too high because what i saw apple do with their silicon has been amazing like their chips are basically the pinnacle of efficiency not to compare too much but when i see iphone 13 pro max getting eight plus hours of screen on time easy with a 4300 milliamp hour battery that's pretty amazing so now i see pixel 6 come out 40 600 milliamp hour battery in the pixel 6 and 5 000 milliamp hours in the 6 pro and they design their own chips so i was thinking this would be amazing it's not so i was consistently getting three and a half to four and a half hours of screen on time on the pixel 6 pro and slightly less on the six which is just average at best it's not that great like that's dead by the end of a long day pretty often now on a 600 phone that's not too crazy you can probably forgive that but on a flagship that's a weakness and then also on top of that you got to remember there is no charging brick in the box like we saw and it supports up to 30 watts of wired charging which is not super fast but it's it's okay and the wireless charging that's supported is even a little bit slower than that so the battery situation for me has been overall kind of a bummer on the flagship i can get around it by just charging all the time like in my car at my desk at work but you never really want to have to do that you kind of just want to be able to use your phone normally and not think about it but hey using this phone when it's not running low on battery has been awesome thanks to android 12. i want to use it all the time totally made over aesthetic material you and all kinds of visual overhaul happening here so i made an entire video about all the new features here which i'll link below that like button but yeah i really like most of it at first it definitely feels like a little spread out like there's a lot of extra blank and like white space in the ui there's these huge ui elements and really big buttons and especially on a huge phone with a huge screen it feels kind of cartoonish at first but it all comes together it's sort of this big flowing bouncy ui with matching colors and lots of nice scrolling physics and haptics it all ties together but yeah it's just nice that no matter what wallpaper i choose for example the quick settings and the settings app and all the menu backgrounds and widgets all find an accent color in the wallpaper and match it right away it's just it's so sweet it's nice it's nice my only little gripe with android 12 is two things actually one that the brightness slider is two swipes away it's all the way at the top and you got to drag it down i i just think that could be way more reachable and way more accessible and the other thing is i don't like the new internet toggle i usually just want to turn wi-fi on or off but now that takes an extra tap and i feel like they could just add a wi-fi toggle in the quick settings but just a general internet one exists but you know what when you think about pixel what do you think of you think of the software and the camera i think the software is pretty great so let's talk about the most distinctive part of this phone the camera so pixels have had the same camera more or less since the pixel 2 right this small 12 megapixel sensor on the pixel 2 was pretty revolutionary for its time and so they kept the same one in pixel 3. and then kept the same one in pixel four and then kept the same one in pixel five and it was fine because others were catching up around them with better hardware but google had figured out a really great way to compensate for the small sensor with incredible software amazing computational photography great hdr and multi-frame bracketing and all this stuff that made their images their night sight all of those photos look incredible it was almost like they just proved with these cameras that the software is more important than the hardware itself but now here we are in 2021 everyone's catching up and so now pixel 6 has launched with a brand new camera system featuring a much better hardware suite a huge 50 megapixel main sensor but you can't actually take 50 megapixel photos there's no high res mode or anything for it it's always binning and everything is down to 12 and a half megapixels and then there's a new 12 megapixel ultra wide and the pro phone also gets a 4x telephoto camera as well so okay been shooting with it i think google's still running all of their camera algorithms at 11 like when they don't need to anymore so this has much better hardware and they had been compensating like i said for a smaller weaker sensor to bring it up and bring out all the magic and now running that same type of look starts to make photos look a bit over processed a little over hdr-y pretty frequently so there are a bunch of interesting things about this camera but like i said 50 megapixels doing 4-1 binning with no option to keep all 50 means you're only really getting a small amount of improved sharpness over the previous but photos are sharp white balance is pretty good but still bias is a little bit too cool sometimes but you can see in regular lighting the pixel does an enormous amount of hdr and it almost looks like someone turned up the clarity slider in photoshop just a little bit too high so shadows never quite get all the way to black and it's very rare that highlights like the sky are ever blown out but then yeah that also gives you a bit of an exaggerated like over-processed look when the photo should just have regular lighting now the thing is this sensor is amazing so it's taking in a ton of light and a lot of information so actually the more difficult high dynamic range shooting situations are handled great like shooting directly into the sun or shooting at night with bright lights these more difficult shots are actually very impressive looking now because the processing is keeping so much information in the final shot but even so these darker scenes tend to overexpose when you don't adjust the slider in the viewfinder so it's really impressive believe me having all this sharpness and almost no noise in a nighttime shot that's technically incredible but it shouldn't look this bright so here's a comparison shot with the iphone 13 pro on full auto just to give you an idea of the difference between night modes it's almost turning night into day on the pixel but here's a pretty perfect example to visualize all this processing on the left is a raw shot from the pixels camera that we colored with just a quick boost to the vibrance and on the right side is a google process jpeg and that sensor you can see is getting a ton of information and detail and the processing is to make it look like what it thinks we want on a phone screen again bringing up the shadows bringing down the highlights sharpening everything but i think the ideal might be somewhere in between these now the ultrawide is pretty good it's not amazing but it has a lot of the same traits as last year and i'm glad they're still in ultra wide there's no macro mode with it though and then the telephoto on the pro was surprisingly good when you're moving around handheld although you still get much better sharpness out of like an s21 ultra google super resume is pretty good at sharpening up and improving shots that would normally be soft but they can still tend to look a little bit like a watercolor painting at the extremes but overall you know as someone who's loved the pixel's rich contrast look and really honestly preferred it for years over pretty much anything else i think this is an almost great camera that can take some tweaks and and maybe some software updates at least i'm hoping to get better because i i've taken some incredible sharp photos with this camera and i've also taken some weird looking ones so basically i guess the question is would you rather have a camera that's a 10 out of 10 sometimes but also a 7 out of 10 some other times or just a camera that just gives you 9 out of 10 9 9 nine every single time because that's the iphone that nine out of ten that consistent shot the iphone 13 pro's camera system is more consistent but the pixels camera aces some shots sometimes but then also gives me a really weird over hdr looking shot that i wouldn't even want to share so bounces back and forth i will say the video from the pixel did really level up kind of the same style as the photos it has great dynamic range great stabilization and that big sensor is giving you real background blur and impressively staying in focus most of the time and in some of these harder scenes you can definitely see the processing working like here when it's trying to bring up the shadows it's pretty noisy but still overall color and exposure and white balance and the details are all great with the pixel 6's video and i'm really happy to see that and then another thing i noticed the pixel really cranks iso all the way up in the viewfinder so you can see a lot of noise before you snap a photo and start the processing like it's very easy to see this here in a screen recording but that's what it's doing you can see in a selfie viewfinder especially it'll look super jacked up and really noisy just to keep a high frame rate and shutter speed when you're taking the selfie and then you take it and you see it process and then everything sharpens up and it looks miles better and while that seemed kind of weird to me at first i actually think this is a good move so tensor has a horsepower to just run the stuff at high iso and the preview might not look great but at least it's not choppy and laggy and then it basically under promises and over delivers people will see the viewfinder and think this will be a bad photo and then they'll be shocked at how good the final photo is when you're taking photos with faces in them the ultrawide camera is always running at a higher shutter speed so if you get someone moving too quick and the primary camera has a blurry face it can merge in the faster sharper face from the ultrawide camera into your shot automatically i mean that's you kind of just never have blurry faces in your photos overall just as someone who's used now both of these phones for a couple weeks iphone's camera system is better than the pixels it just is right now it doesn't it's more consistent it doesn't struggle with over processing it shoots to more formats it's a better overall camera system but this the hardware is so good in the pixels and you can see that promise in those 10 out of 10 shots that the pixel fan in me is like hoping maybe in one or two software updates it'll be a 10 out of 10 more often but until then because we don't know if that's ever gonna happen yeah you saw the sample shots that's that's what it does that's how it looks so yeah i want to come back to the price at the end here like i said 5.99 for pixel 6 8.99 for pixel 6 pro it's a 300 delta and for that difference you're getting 120 hertz over 90 1440p over 1080 a curved screen over a flat one some glossy sides over the matte sides i like the matte sides better then you get an extra telephoto camera on the back and you get a wider selfie camera on the front a little more ram a little bit bigger screen that's kind of it so basically my conclusion is pixel 6 really good phone really really great deal because for 600 bucks this is one of the best ones you can get and then the difference in money to get to six pro it makes it a better phone than the pixel six sure a lot of good stuff here but this stuff doesn't vault it over the top of all the other flagships it just you know i would get this phone if you've really got to have the telephoto or the ultra wide selfie camera or the bigger faster screen that's kind of the main bullets but i think pixel 6 is almost incredible and the truth is this is the most important google phone yet this this pivot to you know from enthusiast phones and really cool cameras and software features to still being the smartest smartphone in the world but also now having much better hardware this new design and making their own chip and competing like really competing i'm into it i'm super into it so that's fun to see that's pixel six and six pro it's techtober so there's still a lot more to talk about so stay tuned for that stuff subscribe if you haven't already thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace [Music] 
21,NE5H5intsck,Google Pixel 7/Pro Review: Hard Problems? Software Answers!,2022-10-12T17:00:29Z,"{'viewCount': '4620514', 'likeCount': '149088', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '6518'}",foreign [Music] pixel sevens seven and seven per I'm using these songs for about a week now and yes they are very similar to last year they're the same prices too but more than ever this year and you can see it at every corner the pixel special is software solutions to Hardware problems and this is in contrast to say the Samsung or the xiaomi special which is throw as much raw Hardware horsepower at the thing as possible there's just no way that isn't better than before and there's nothing right or wrong with either of these approaches matter of fact as a Tech head you can kind of appreciate both but there is there is just a little bit of a magic to this software way at least when it works so yeah I can definitely appreciate the slightly updated Hardware on the outside of the pixel because even though it isn't super important to the Google Mission it's still important to the users so initially with my very first Hands-On I didn't love it but it's kind of growing on me the main change here being the metal camera bar instead of the All Glass visor from last year it lets them do some interesting stuff with the colors but most importantly lets them make it all one piece of metal all the way around with the frame of the rest of the phone it's polished aluminum on the pro and matte aluminum on the pixel 7. then both phones also get brighter displays up to 1500 nits Peak on the 7 Pro and 1400 nits on the regular pixel 7. can't fake that with software and then the 7 Pro display is larger slightly curved over the edges and a generally better looking display with less off-axis rainbowing but interestingly it's set to 1080p out the box by default even though it's a 1440p panel I immediately switched that to 1440 and have had no battery issues so I recommend doing that matter of fact might as well just say it right off the top I have had great battery experiences with these phones I've been mostly dailying the 7 Pro David at the studio has been dailying the seven and yeah they've been excellent like just this morning today drove into the studio had an hour-long commute with Waze on full brightness GPS streaming Spotify audio through Bluetooth to the car got here with like 85 battery left and I'm consistently ending days with 30 to 40 percent six to seven hours is not a problem uh yeah I've had very good battery life on these phones very impressive that's a combination of software optimization better modems just better chip overall but speaking of chips inside the phone there are very few new specs but the new second generation tensor G2 from Google is one of them there's also a little bit extra RAM on the pro phone it does Benchmark a bit higher than the first tensor but in terms of raw power it's right in line with the Snapdragon 865 fine but just like I talked about in the problem with benchmarks video which you can watch here if you haven't seen it already Google is optimizing this tensor G2 chip to work more efficiently specifically with its AI stuff it's AI magic so while yeah the G2 is a little faster than the first tensor with its smaller four nanometer process node the real improvements are in its machine learning capabilities which are 60 faster and 20 percent more efficient than last year so the things that actually require those AI smarts are dramatically better and faster so that is where it starts to get interesting not to dismiss the you know slight improvements of the pixel overall I mean you can see they even they painted inside the port and the speakers down here to match the rails of the phone it's nice I like it but that's not what the pixel is all about the pixel is the software it is the smartest smartphone and pretty much all the reasons you'd pick a phone like a pixel 7 over the rest are in the software like for phone calls for example pixel is the only phone with call screening which to me is still super useful but it also goes to another level so when you call a business that has an automated system the improved direct my call feature will surface all the buttons at once so you can press to navigate through an automated system before the robot even finishes saying them it saves me so much time I love that I also like the new home screen search which still has all the great functionality as before it's just cleaner and better designed and then with the new selfie camera the pixel has added AI based Face Unlock which is great but as you can see it's just a single selfie camera up top here there's no infrared depth mapping or face ID equivalent so while it's super fast in great conditions it absolutely struggles as expected when you're in the dark or when you have a mask on so there's also still an under display fingerprint reader for dual biometric authentication anytime Face Unlock fails I will say I was hoping that the fingerprint reader would be one of the things that improved to the pixel 7 Hardware wise because the one in the six was a little bit of a letdown for me it's it's not noticeably bigger or faster it's fine it's not terrible it's just a slight step behind the ultrasonic ones which are noticeably faster than this Optical one oh also the recorder app most some people don't even care about this but the recorder app is better it's already the best in the world at doing incredibly fast and accurate speech to text you've seen this before thanks tensor but I got an amazing demo of somebody starting a recording and then putting the phone in their pocket and we had a full-on conversation they took the phone out of their pocket and it had perfectly transcribed our entire conversation with speaker labels so each time the opposite person spoke it labeled that incredibly useful or incredibly creepy depending on who you are but that's one of the features that's allegedly coming later this year to an update I'm going to be using that and it just definitely feels like anywhere you go on this phone Google assistant is waiting right around the corner waiting to help you out it was the same with the last pixel Android 13 got its improvements with material U and the under the hood improvements but just the Google stuff everywhere the routines the little reminders the little chip cards words and messages for helpful things you might want to do to add to a message there's a lot of good stuff there's even a new feature called photo unblur you might have seen the demos basically takes any photo in your pixel 7's Library actually anything in your Google photos library at all and if it's a little bit blurry you hit that unblur button and it can use AI to identify what the scene should look like and fix the photo remove the blur seems super cool so okay after trying this with a bunch of photos we found that it seems to work best specifically with photos of subjects that are in Focus but the exposure time was too long and so now there's a bit of blur in One Direction in that exact instance I found it can do a pretty good job of turning a streaky blurry photo into something much more usable I wouldn't expect anything magical but you know this is pretty cool it's the definition of using software to solve Hardware problems also if they do say pixel 7 exclusive for this feature for now I don't really buy it they say it's because of temps or G2 I give it about a year before this feature is available for more phones maybe anyone using Google photos but hey for now gotta have a pixel 7. but the point is Google is not setting out to make a phone with the absolute best hardware and the best display and the absolute best raw performance I mean if they are they're failing but Google pixel is absolutely the smartest smartphone in the room it's the smartest phone you can get and it's even more true again this year now the pixel has been known for one other thing probably as long as anything else and that's the cameras and there's an updated Suite of cameras on the front and the back of the pixel 7s this year so the 50 megapixel primary camera is the same on both same as last year the pro gets a new even wider Ultra wide with autofocus while the 7 keeps the one from last year and the pro also gets a new 5x 48 megapixel telephoto camera and as expected the pixel 7 and 7 Pro take X excellent photos in a variety of different lighting conditions and they have that very distinct pixel style the high dynamic range contrasty lots of detail those shots this big sensor can create some pretty nice natural depth of field still without using portrait mode I love that I know I shouldn't be super impressed that you know normal daylight photos look great on the pixel but hey these are really really good and then the new Pro Ultra wide does a really good job with macro photography doesn't do macro video but this photo of an ant is really hard to get and the auto switching to macro mode can be disabled if you're like me and prefer taking close-up photos of things with the main camera just be aware of minimum Focus distance but then here's another great example of solving Hardware problems with software the zoom so the One X camera still normal 1X that's a 50 megapixel main sensor binning down to 12 megapixels the 2x button is a 12 megapixel crop of the middle of the frame so a high quality Zoom then from 2x to 5 5x the camera is actually doing some composition it's adding detail in the middle of the frame from the telephoto camera and then compositing them together then you get to 5x and it's snapping to the full telephoto camera that makes perfect sense then again the 10x is taking a 12 megapixel crop of the middle of the telephoto so another high quality zoom and it's pretty good I will say it's not quite as good as having a dedicated 10x telephoto camera on the back of the phone like having a dedicated camera is always going to give you the sharper overall image but for someone like me who only zooms once in a while the whole super resume software solution is very passable as you can see and then that saves you money and then you get the zoom stabilization that activates at 15x and it is really really stable maybe a little too stable sometimes because it kind of makes it hard to track like moving objects which I know you love to do when you're creeping I mean bird watching anyway yeah the pixels camera right still top of the Heap when it comes to point and shoot Android cameras the shutter speed is super fast so if you're trying to freeze motion and also capture like an exact moment this camera is really good at that the selfie cameras on both are also improved it's now an 11 megapixel selfie camera they both do ultra wide selfies now instead of just the pro love that and video is slightly better too including 10-bit HDR tough to show that in this SDR video but if you've seen HDR video before you know where this excels already anything with bright specular highlights loads of dynamic range Etc it's still a step behind the iPhone when it comes to noise levels and autofocus so for those curious why I still put the iPhone as the overall king of smartphone imagery that's why but this is not far behind by any means okay here's a couple other small things that didn't fit into the rest of this review the speakers on the 7 Pro are slightly louder but slightly less Bassy than the 6 Pro just a little tinier so a little less low end for a little bit more vocal Clarity I found that interesting and then there's not a whole lot going for sustainability for these phones other than the metal visor and frame being made with 100 recycled materials some pretty specific wording there but also the box that comes in which doesn't have a charger does come with a cable and an adapter and is fully recyclable cardboard and then a big question are there bugs because my pixel 6 experience was a roller coaster I mean I I love the phone to start but then it's slowly descended into having more and more bugs until I it was like unusable to me and I stopped using it then it got some updates that squashed those bugs and then I ended up dailying it for like the last two months or so so all their bugs on the pixel 7s yeah I have found some I mean I had this media player bug where it just shows a blank space where the media player is supposed to be whether or not there was any media playing that did go away after reboot there was also this weird thing where after you hit the X in the Google search bar that button just disappears but it's still pressable for some reason also I tried to post the Instagram story from the pixel 7 Pro the other day and it just looked like this for some reason honestly no idea what happened here everyone saw it apparently some people thought it was an ad for dbrand's new digital camo it wasn't but this is hey if your new metal bar isn't enough and you want your new pixel to look even more different from the rest Channel sponsor dbrand's new skin is pretty sick and it's a foolproof way to make your phone look unique plus it hopes to hide that dust that sort of naturally accumulates right above and below the camera bar so link below of course right below that like button but I've really enjoyed using the pixel and that's why it's going in my pocket as my daily driver phone for now anyway as far as whether you should get one or not I think the real question is how much money are you willing to spend because same prices as last year 5.99 8.99 and I think my initial feeling is I still feel the same which some people got kind of Twisted by the way but the 300 difference between these phones the pixel 7 is a way better deal than the 7 Pro like they're both well priced and they're both very competitive and frankly undercutting most of what they're competing against but the seven is just for most people a no-brainer so uh this is the phone I'm gonna be recommending more often probably a value phone of the Year Contender again look there's a lot of stuff Google didn't do with the pixels like they didn't do super fast 80 watt charging they didn't do multiple telephoto cameras it doesn't even fold in half right there's a lot of stuff but for patient Pixel People Who prefer pristine programming and pretty pictures the pixel Pro is pretty perfect [Music] 
22,BS8x2TicxQ8,Google Pixel 8/8 Pro Review: We'll Fix It In Post!,2023-10-11T17:10:01Z,"{'viewCount': '3125932', 'likeCount': '114482', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '5446'}","- So a common phrase
in the video world is, eh, we'll fix it in post. Meaning the shot isn't quite perfect, but we'll just fix that
stuff in post-production, kinda like this. (drums rolling) (magical music) There you go. Or how about a little bit of this too? (drums rolling) (magical music) There we go, much better. See, it's not that it's
a lazy way of doing it, but I feel like a good filmmaker tries to get as reliably good in camera as possible instead of
relying on software. And the we'll fix it in
post version of a smartphone is definitely the Google Pixel. So many of the Pixel's best features are literally fixing it in post, right? Oh, is your face blurry
in that picture you took? Fine, Face Unblur. Fix it in post. Oh, what's that? You didn't quite get that
angle right on your photo? Magic Editor. Fix it in post. Oh, was there a weird background audio in that video you took? Easy, we got Audio Eraser, fix it in post, and many of these strategies
with a little help from AI, actually work and that's
where the Pixel shines. But there's also some
things about smartphones that you kind of just
can't really fix in post. First things first. The design on the outside of these phones looks, I would say, familiar. It looks like the past few years of Pixel which I actually really like, but I also do think this
one's a little bit better in a few ways. First of all, the camera circles did the iPhone Dynamic Island thing of combining themselves
into one big circle which I actually like with
these new bigger sensors here. And then also the Pro Pixels now have a completely flat display, so finally moving away from
the slightly curved edges from the past years and a
satin back in every color which does a shockingly good
job at hiding fingerprints, if your team know case like I am. Aside from that though, everything else is right
where you'd expect it. The one thing I wanna see
if maybe they can fix now is the dust that always accumulates like right under and above the camera bar. Probably the only way to get rid of that is to sort of curve it like they did on the Oppo Find X4 and X3, but I don't know if they'll ever do that. But the biggest improvement
to the hardware though is definitely upfront, honestly to the point where
I feel like these new screens sort of tie the phone together
in a way that they're up at the level of any other flagship phone. So the smaller Pixel 8 now has a 6.2-inch 1080P OLED display, slightly smaller than last year. And that display is surrounded now by perfectly thin even
bezels all the way around, no more tiny chin like previous years. And it's now bumped up
to 120 hertz display that gets up to a new maximum
2,000 nits of brightness which is incredible. It's super bright. They're naming it the Actua display because they feel the
need to name everything. But I love how it's visible all the time. Auto brightness has also been
behaving this time around which is great. It's not LTPO though, so you'll still probably wanna turn off the always on display to
save a bit of battery. But then the Pixel 8 Pro
has a new 6.7-inch display. It is LTPO, it's closer to 1440P and it maxes out at 2,400
nits max brightness. This one is legitimately up there with the brightest displays I've ever seen on a smartphone in person and I definitely did not expect
that to come from a Pixel. They're naming this the
Super Actua display. So the result is a hardware package on the outside of the phone that honestly feels like you can put it right up alongside any
flagships from Xiaomi, Samsung, or anyone else, you name it. Just from the way it's
built, the way it feels, the metal rails, the satin back, the clickiness of the buttons,
the super bright display, the even bezels, everything about it, it's just this is a rare
W for Pixel hardware. And then two other small things
about this display, though. One, it's still just a single
front-facing camera at the top but Google has found a way with software to get more information out of this camera in order to be able to
use it for secure unlock for things like banking apps
and logging into things. So basically instead of
adding more hardware up front like an infrared camera or
a dot projector or radar, if you remember that,
they just fix it in post with software magic and it's convenient. But then number two, the fingerprint reader has not improved. So remember we were talking
about this in the past few years of Pixels, all the best,
the highest end flagships feels like they all have that super fast ultrasonic
fingerprint reader. This one is still optical
and still just a little bit, just a beat slower than the high end ones. It's not horrible, but you
can tell it's not as fast or as consistently accurate
with like rain on your phone as something like a Samsung phone. It's also not any bigger, either. But hey, as long as we're
talking about the Pixel, we might as well just get right into talking about the camera because this is where you're gonna see the fix it in post pushed
to its absolute maximum, more than any other phone. So the new camera
sensors across the board, they do plenty of heavy
lifting, of course, it's a big 50-megapixel primary sensor shared across both the 8 and the 8 Pro, F1.7 OIS and Pixel photos, they look good, they're sharp, there's tons
of dynamic range as expected. Auto focus is really fast and it can get a pretty
shallow depth of field with close up subjects, which is nice. But really most of what you're looking at when you look at a Pixel
photo or video is software. So the multiple exposures blended together into a single HDR shot, the strategic relighting
of recognized faces. I also, I do feel like there's a little extra noise reduction this year. So sometimes details
get kind of watercolory but at least there's enough resolution that it doesn't look
terrible when zoomed out. And I've also found there
is definitely a tendency to over-HDR some images sometimes. And when it comes to
features, well, oh my god, there are so many now. You probably already
know about Magic Eraser. Look, oh, what's that? You've taken a photo and
someone's in the background, you wanna get rid of 'em. Boom, Magic Eraser, fix it in post. Oh, what's that? You have a photo where someone's
moving a little too fast or the hands were shaky and
the face is kind of blurry. Well, there's a feature
called Face Unblur, literally fix it in post. And then even this new
one called The Best Take, people with kids are gonna love this one. Basically, you know how
anytime you take a group photo where there's like five or
six people in the photo, you just blast, you just
take a bunch of pictures and inevitably, one person's face, they're either blinking
or sneezing or something. It's never perfect. But this feature will let
you go into that group shot. And this is for any group
shot you've ever taken in your Google Photos library, by the way, not just a shot on the Pixel. And it automatically
recognizes the burst of photos and lets you pick the best
face from the whole burst on each person in the photo with surprisingly impressive accuracy. You will genuinely never
have that one person with their eyes closed
or looking the wrong way in a group photo ever again. I guess that makes your
holiday cards that much easier. But also even in videos, you know, I've taken a lot of videos
on the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, there's a lot of processing happening. I do think Pixel video is
improved over last year. It's less noisy in the shadows and there's some nice
shallow depth of field with quick autofocus. I shot almost the entire
Corvette Z06 autofocus video on the Pixel 8 Pro and I
think it looks really good, but also in a lot of the shots of my face, there's this artificial
brightening processing, like you can see it in my
footage before I start talking. When it lands on my face, how
it just brightens up my face and adds this contrast and
just throughout the footage, there is a good amount of
processed sharpening going on. Also, the Audio Eraser video feature is all right, I would say. Again, you can only fix so much in post, but basically they show this feature where if you're taking videos and there's some background noise, you can go into the editor and separate out like the
layers of different sounds. So there's this really cool UI that they've built in
that is super impressive. You go into Edit Audio and Audio Eraser. It analyzes the video and
then lets you drag up or down levels of different
sounds it's identified. So nature and voices and background sounds and wind, you know, depends
on what video you took. It does okay with small
stuff, but like, I don't know, it's super impressive at a low level, but then it can't really
save the most disruptive wind around our studio or the exhaust sound of a five and a half liter
naturally aspirated V8. Like it's not magic. About this in the main channel in the Rimac Nevera video. That car is electric and basically has multiple personalities and this one kind of does in the same way. You've probably heard the other cliche of. I will say shout out to the colors though. Honestly the color in
Pixel video is really good. If you told me I could only take pictures by taking stills from
video of any smartphone, I think I would pick the Pixel 8 Pro. Just the footage looks so good. Now Google, here's the
thing about being so good at software visibly is it
becomes way more obvious when you're suddenly not able
to pull off a software trick on the non-Pro phone that
you are able to pull off on the Pro phone, even though
they're the same computer. Like the good thing that you
did was put the same exact chip the Tensor G3 with the
same image signal processor and the same primary camera
and the same selfie camera in the pro and the non-Pro phones. So this sort of artificial separation between the Pro and the non-Pro
with like software locking, it was obvious when Apple did it and it's even more obvious
when Google does it. So if you open up the camera and switch over to Pro Controls, that's only available on the Pro phone. Now, that's funny. Of course, you can argue the non-Pro phone doesn't need Pro controls, but
it's clearly capable of them. Even if you bury them in
settings, it's the same computer. They also both have a 50-megapixel sensor, but because it's locked
under the Pro mode, you can only take 50-megapixel
shots on the Pro phone. The non-Pro phone is always binning. Theoretically that's
gonna be one of the things that you'll have to pay
the 300 extra dollars to get up to the Pro phone for, but also someone's already
ported it to the Pixel 6. So like, come on, Google, you ain't slick. There's even a blog post
about some other features that are coming to the Pixel. They have this thing called Zoom Enhance. That's basically a generative
fill version of Super Res Zoom that's coming later this year only to Pixel 8 Pro for some reason. And especially improved
MagicERraser version that uses Generative Fill on the 8 Pro and only the 8 Pro. - It's ridiculous. It's obvious what's being done out here. It's a nightly basis. I hope the world can see now what's really going on out here 'cause it's getting ridiculous. It's really ridiculous. - Okay, last camera thing. Magic Editor is... It's wild. It's one of the wildest
things they've ever made. It is available on both phones and it definitely goes
beyond fixing it in post. So you open up a photo, you hit Edit, and then at the bottom left corner, there's this wonderful colorful
rainbow Magic Editor button just tempting you to press it. From here, the editor
UI is basically saying, all right, go ahead and select
something with your hands and then we can change it. We can do whatever you want to it. Select an object and you can
remove it, move it around, resize it, select a person,
we can move 'em up or down or hit the bottom middle button
to switch the whole scene to golden hour or replace
the entire sky in your photo. And then once you submit the edit it takes a few seconds to process, and then kind of like DALL·E, it gives you four options of this edit to pick whichever version
is the most convincing. They're not, you know, professional
photographer level edits meaning you can zoom in and Pixel peep and find some edges sometimes
that look weird here or there. I also did try the exact
same Generative Fill example that they showed in their commercials of this kid on a park bench where it oppressively fills
in the missing balloons. When I do it, it kind of tries to do that, but definitely doesn't
do it nearly as well. But the truth is zoomed all the way out, these are decently convincing
edits to regular people and you can just do it with
any photo in your library, so it really just feels
like without knowing how to use Photoshop or any of these image generation AI tools, the Pixel Magic Editor,
basically what it did is just it lowered the barrier
to entry to just lie I guess. Now every once in a while,
I did get a popup box over my edit attempt that said
it's unable to show results because it might violate our gen AI terms. But I was never able to
find like exactly why or any trend in this. It seemed to come up more often when I tried to edit
a picture of a person, but then it would totally let
me just select a watermark in a photo and effortlessly delete that, which is probably gonna be
concern for some photographers. So yeah, I would just say
that I'm probably gonna end up making an entire separate
video just about this tool 'cause it's fascinating and what it brings into the world is wild. But I don't know. What is a photo? But you know what you
can't fix in post, though? Battery life. You can't AI your way out
of a huge 2,400 nit screen burning through battery. You're just gonna need the hardware, you're gonna need a big battery you're gonna need an
efficient chip for this one. And I'm happy to report that I have had really good
battery life on the Pixels. And this is especially on the 8 Pro. So I've gotten six to eight
hours of screen on time regularly, standby time has been decent. My only real question at this
point is, and I only ask this because of the history
we've seen with the Pixel, how long will the battery
life be this good? Because, you know, it could
be great for a few months and then start to fade
like previous Pixels, or maybe it'll be great for years, the whole time you own the phone. Only time will tell. At the end of the day though,
the Pixel is still great at what it's always been great
at, which is being smart. Like there are so many features, from call screening, to
Google Assistant everywhere, Google's stock apps getting so good. And the more I use the
Pixel as my daily phone, as I have for so long, the more I just kind of
get used to this stuff and the harder it is to live
without it on another phone. Android 14 has already breathed life into older pixels already. Literally my biggest primary bug is clicking Twitter
notifications, for some reason, Just take an extra beat
and a half to open. Kind of weird. One of the new features on this one is when you're in any webpage in Chrome, you can pull up Google
Assistant and just ask it for a summary of the entire
webpage you're reading. And Google Assistant
with this new AI features reads your screen and generates a summary of three or four bullet points that are typically pretty good. Now I wanna try this
with a few other apps, but I basically always got an error saying this app doesn't support summaries, So it looks like the app developers are gonna have to opt in
to have their apps scraped by the summaries which I kind of suspect a lot of them are not gonna do that. Even Google's own news
app doesn't support it. So this basically is just a Chrome thing. And then after the summary, it gives you a few cards
to ask follow up questions about the subject and just
keep Googling more stuff. But then just this phone gets a lot of the little stuff right too. Just the little things that
make it feel like a flagship. The haptics are excellent. Like it's got some of the
highest quality phone calls I've ever heard on a
phone, stuff like that. Overall, when you put fit
and finish and hardware up alongside software experience, and I think these new screens especially, it feels like this is finally
the generation of Pixel that is right alongside
the other flagships of the smartphone world. And it gets supported like a flagship too. Seven years of software updates, seven years of feature drop updates, seven years of security updates, seven years of spare parts available. And it'll do so for the
new starting price of $700. And I think it's worth it. I honestly, I think this
is worth the new price tag. I think everything they've
done from the 120 hertz and the brighter screen across the board, this is a phone that I would
have no problem recommending. Now, is the 300 extra
dollars for the Pro worth it? That one's gonna be tough. And again, it's because
Google did such a good job with feature parity, same
chip, same primary camera between these, so it's gonna come down to the couple of small
differences between them. Do you want that telephoto
camera and the bigger screen, bigger battery, bigger phone,
the temperature sensor? I don't know. It's harder to recommend
the Pro for most people, but the Pixel 8, this is a good phone. So that's basically it. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace. (light music) "
23,ySMGudnpdXQ,Asus ZenFone 6: Swivel Camera Magic!,2019-05-29T21:23:03Z,"{'viewCount': '2843624', 'likeCount': '75033', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '5800'}",[Music] foreign [Music] Hardware is back this is the Asus Zenfone 6. this is one of the bigger surprises for phones this year coming in at 500 bucks so this isn't a full review of the cell phone it's more of an impressions of what's turned into yet another way to avoid the Notch and what's ended up being one of the more interesting impressive mid-range phones of 2019. so the Zenfone 6 has a 6.4 inch full HD Plus IPS LCD display rounded Corners as you can see but of course no Notch no cutouts no hole punch no interruptions now the ads show it as this kind of Glorious full screen display from edge to edge and corner to corner you know it's a little more of a chin and a bezel than that but we'll go with it so how do they achieve this in a 500 phone and where do they put that front-facing stuff well the fingerprint reader they didn't put under the glass it's still on the back and I still like this it's lower and sort of in the middle so it's super reachable it's right where my finger naturally rests it's the same place I like it on the pixel phones and the earpiece speaker is still up in this little slot here at the top alongside actually an LED notification light which is rare nowadays there isn't much customization to it but I like that it's there and then the selfie camera well you've seen it by now it's the main camera flipped around it's kind of great it's this massive chassis with dual cameras that sort of flips around when you go to selfie mode and takes the front-facing shot and it's not quite either those Motors make a sound every time but believe it or not this is not the first camera or phone that I've used to do this back in 2013 I actually reviewed What's called the Oppo N1 this gigantic phone running CyanogenMod with like the world's largest forehead and chin and a 13 megapixel camera in this Barb at the top that doubled as your selfie camera if you swiveled it around the main difference of course was this one was manual so you swiveled it around with your hands like a caveman but uh yeah this one from Asus in 2019 is electronic it's motorized and like I said it's actually dual cameras so you have a 48 megapixel F 1.8 main sensor and a 13 megapixel Ultra wide as well and then because it's motorized you have all kinds of extra features but also all kinds of other stuff to worry about so first of all don't expect this to be water resistant anymore there's no IP rating for this phone and I just don't think you'd want to get any water near this piece anyway and even duster dirt getting in there could eventually be an actual problem so you got to be careful with it and then of course there's no way you want anything to impact it or have anything bend it the motor already makes some pretty concerning noises when it encounters any resistance but like I said the motor actually gives you the ability to do a bunch of other interesting things the first being the volume rocker isn't a shutter button anymore it's actually a controller to control the exact precise angle that you want that camera to flip up at any given time which is fascinating and then the software button becomes a slider to do the same thing so now you have this fine control over the exact angle of this swiveling camera chassis at any time I don't know if that becomes kind of useful or just kind of creepy that you can hold it at whatever angle you want but it seems firmly in the gimmick bucket to me at least that feature but then in panorama mode there is a fully automatic Panorama tilt so if you can take a vertical or horizontal Panorama by just hitting the button and it uses the motors to move the lens for you across the frame this is actually kind of useful I could see someone just holding the phone perfectly still and it'll spin up to a full 180 degrees to flat or until you tell it stop essentially maximizing your Panorama quality now I don't know how often you take panoramas personally I don't do this a ton but it works really well and it's kind of hilarious that you can get yourself into the Panorama if you let it flip all the way around so that that is a clever use of the motor and then there is object tracking mode so if you're trying to take a video or something without moving the phone of a subject you can have it latch on to what what looks like just contrast based object detection and then as long as that subject moves to the left basically the camera can swivel over and keep it in the frame as long as you keep that video going for me this was pretty finicky from my experience since the contrast based detection isn't perfect but I guess I could see people taking videos maybe of themselves using this and it also has drop protection as well so you remember how the OnePlus would sort of retract the selfie camera if it detected free fall this one if it detects free fall we'll just snap back that camera where it was to avoid it you know Landing weird and crunching it um it actually snaps back a little bit faster than it normally goes in and out in regular use which I think is it just preserving the motor's life but it's rated for a hundred thousand opens and closes I feel like I've already opened and closed it like a thousand times but that's at least good for a couple years and then the camera quality itself is actually pretty good so I gotta be honest I wasn't expecting much out of the Zenfone but if the pixels camera is my a plus then this is a solid B minus to a b so it's gotten a couple software updates and there are more coming I think it's main problem still is dynamic range and inconsistency like it can't really be trusted to take a great shot every time and the ultrawide camera while it's nice to have really is much worse than the main camera but the main camera especially as a selfie camera is quite good so shots are detailed color is pretty good uh it's edge to edge sharp and then when you swivel it around to face yourself of course that's going to be right up there is now one of the best selfie cameras so it's one of the only ones to actually get real background blur and depth of field that isn't fake on a selfie so yeah this whole camera mechanism by itself is fascinating but there is of course the whole rest of the phone here that's low-key a really nice collection of choices and pieces to put together for a 500 phone it has a high-end specs Snapdragon 855 and up to eight gigs of RAM and it's an all metal and glass build and it's Hefty like this is a chunky solid phone and a big part of that is because it has a 5 000 milliamp hour battery inside that is absolutely massive and I think that now makes it the largest battery cell in a phone I've ever used it doesn't charge quite as fast as some others because of the way the cell is built and it has 18 watt fast charging and no wireless charging but that's much more acceptable when you can imagine how long a 5 000 milliamp hour battery with a 1080p display will probably last that's exciting in a phone by itself and I'm happy that phone batteries just keep getting bigger at this rate uh there's also Bluetooth 5.0 there is a headphone jack there's some pretty good speakers which a lot of phones in this range don't have a power button with this ring of blue paint around it and then it has this extra button up above the volume rocker that by default is a Google Assistant button so you can remap it to a couple other functions so it's kind of halfway to being awesome this extra button so technically yes they let you customize it but it's with a couple of sort of quick actions that they've pre-selected I have single pressed to Google Assistant double press to open or turn on the flashlight which is cool but they don't just let you open whatever app you want with it that would have been what I really wanted you know single press for Google Tasks double tap for Google Assistant something like that but you can't do that and then it's also kind of hard to reach so I love having these extra customizable buttons but this one is so high up that you need sort of a whole hand shimmy just to reach it I kind of just wish it was on the other side of the volume rocker which is blank but hey it's up there so one of the biggest most welcome changes on this whole phone is Asus finally dropping that massive zenui skin and bringing it way back to near stock Android dropping all the bloatware all the unnecessary duplicate apps and the Ugly launcher and custom icons and themes and settings and things we didn't like this is much better much cleaner and hopefully that spells faster software updates as well so yeah Zenfone 6. it's definitely one of the surprises of the Year for me so far of course being a pretty great all-around budget phone that happens to have one really impressive swively camera feature not to be be clear this is definitely still a workaround this isn't like the permanent solution on our way to bezel-less phones This falls in the category of notches and hole punch cutouts and pop-up cameras but it's a pretty cool one I guess this specific version of it with the swiveling camera I don't hate it like it's obviously not practical for long-term future Solutions but for me I think I'm a sucker for camera quality over like anything else as far as practicality like that's why I was so into the pixel 3 for so long despite so many of the issues that it had so when I saw this one this just flips around and becomes one of the best quality selfie cameras instantly that to me made me kind of like it a lot more but we'll keep an eye on this phone and a bunch more coming in the future but as far as I can tell definitely a pretty great all-around 500 phone but let me know would you would you get a phone with a swiveling camera like this would you be into it let me know in the comments section below either way thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace 
24,AxV0_1Y4zl0,Asus Zenfone 9: The New Compact King!,2022-08-01T22:23:11Z,"{'viewCount': '3826999', 'likeCount': '142042', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '7549'}",hey what's up mkbhd here so if you're one of those people who has ever thought wow seems like all the phones coming out these days look and feel the same well this one's for you because this is one of the most contrarian against the grain set of features i've seen in a new phone in a long time so this is the asus zenfone 9 and the more you look around this phone the more you see it's just not like very many other phones first of all flagship phones these days are getting bigger and bigger than ever we know this this phone is actually refreshingly compact it has slightly bigger bezels but those are around a 5.9 inch display so maybe not many but pretty close and that translates to so many little things just feeling smaller in the pocket smaller in the hand obviously reachability of the whole display is easier it's great and then you already know most flagships these days are working with glass they're usually pretty shiny and glossy backs this one is plastic but it is a sort of a nice textured uh softer touch plastic bag it's not quite the rough sandstone of the classic oneplus phones but it is somewhere in between it's got a little more grip which combined with the flat aluminum sides of this phone are quite nice to hold plus it has all these little design cues you know the little notch cut out around the metal of the power button the little bits of text on the back of the phone not full-on rog phone levels of text but it is something and the notch cut out around what is that oh yes a headphone jack yet another piece of this phone that you just don't see very often in many new phones out there plus just when's the last time you saw a red phone the only thing i don't like about this design might just be that the size of the camera bumps makes the whole thing rock when it's flat on a table but we'll get to those cameras in a second a lot of phones have been moving their fingerprint readers to underneath the display which fair they've gotten pretty good lately maybe haven't improved that much in the last year or two asus said you know what we're going to take this power button and we're going to double it as our fingerprint reader but not only that we're going to have it triple as a smart key so you can customize both a double press and a long press to start a quick action you can start google assistant with it or open literally whatever app you want and then not only that we're also going to have it quadruple has a reachability hack where you can swipe the button down to pull the notification shade down at any time anywhere from any screen just like samsung did back in the day with the galaxy s10e i think it was and asus has really gone the extra mile just to make sure you can reach everything on the phone with one hand they've also got a little edge tool to let you quickly launch apps with your thumb from the side what else do most normal flagship phones have these days i think you could argue a pretty heavily customized software experience is pretty common i'm happy to report though that asus is taking the opposite approach with a fairly lightweight just couple of additions on top of nearly stock android so zen ui which is what it's called just adds a couple things here and there and it's doing wonders for this phone first of all for performance i mean there's no real bloatware here things are pretty light this phone also has a 120 hertz display and combined with the top of the line snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 and 8 to 16 gigs of ram things have been very smooth pretty much all the time which is awesome and for usability they just find a couple places to tuck some extra features into the settings around the material u elements that are smart like little thoughtful additions here and there i like i like that they lifted the display animation speeds that are usually buried in developer settings and just put it right into the display settings they always on display you can customize a little bit to look differently and they put a bunch of stuff in the advanced section including mapping a double back tap to a custom action or a custom one-handed mode for even better reachability and actually one of my favorites you can super easily customize which camera modes show up at the bottom so you aren't always scrolling around looking for the option you want no matter which one it is so then battery life yo let me talk to you about the battery life on this phone so typically on a smaller phone especially a small flagship phone that's one of the weakest parts of the phone which makes perfect sense there's a lot going on in a small space so there's not a lot of room for much battery this zenfone 9 has a 4300 milliamp hour battery which is pretty big for the small size of this phone and when i put my sim card in it honestly i was expecting about the status quo you know i set the 120 hertz refresh rate because that's what i'm into and i got way way more than i was expecting this phone actually has seriously incredible battery life it sips power turns out this is actually a really good phone to put the snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 in because not only is it more powerful at the highest end but it's also more efficient than the previous chip so great standby time and a lot of quick bursty stuff has handled no problem but i was having like heavy days of using a lot of high brightness screen on time navigation playing some games just doing a bunch of stuff that typically drains phones and it just lasted for a long time i was having seven plus hour screen on time days and ending with 10 20 left really great battery on this phone and hey while we're at things that punch above their weight class the cameras back here the cameras are probably better than what you're expecting now the main sensor here is actually the same one that was in the nothing phone and the rog phone 6 both of which took like b to b plus quality photos at best and were a noticeable step behind the flagships in pretty much every way so same chip in here but two things are different one they put this entire sensor in this huge six axis hybrid gimbal stabilization setup and two we know a lot of what makes a good smartphone camera these days is software so the zenfone 9 takes photos that look very different from say the rog phone which actually asus also makes or the nothing phone basically if you've watched my blind smartphone camera test in the past this statement won't shock you but the zenfone 9 has the closest look of a pixel phone of any non-pixel camera so a typical zenfone 9 photo is very bold and contrasty and saturated so straight off the rip it's pretty nice if anything it can have the tendency to go over the top and really over process and over hdr things that looks kind of harsh and you can really see that in higher dynamic range situations but the extra stabilization does help not just for video but also for taking less noisy photos in the dark at least on the main camera it's still not freezing moving subjects very well because you need a fast shutter speed and a bigger sensor to do that reliably but out of all the phones with this sensor i think this one looks the best the ultra wide is also pretty consistent with color to match the main camera so shout out to asus for their software processing in the zenfone cameras over the years maybe pass some of that along to the uh rog phone team you know maybe have a meeting or two so i've said a lot of positive things about this phone so i'm just going to say one more which is i think the price is really good it starts at 6.99 which actually when i first started i put my sim card in this phone like two weeks ago didn't really know much about it and i hadn't been told the price yet and i would have guessed higher than that it kind of reminds me of when uh pixel 5 came out and it was the best pixel at the time but it was a snapdragon 7 series it was 90 hertz and we we're hoping for like a full flagship pixel this feels like a pixel 5 pro like two years later it's got the highest end chip it's got a nice screen an incredible battery life uh not a whole lot of downside i'm gonna say actually this phone at this price is my favorite release this year i am very impressed with it now it's not perfect and we already know no phone is perfect it's got a few key trade-offs and so i'm going to nitpick because that's what i have to do but here's what's wrong with this phone so battery life is incredible like i said but the max charging speed 30 watts that's decent but there is no wireless charging that's missing lots of people love reminding me that they don't really care about wireless charging but hey almost every other phone at this price is gonna at least have the option so that's something to note and then this display that i was telling you about it is definitely super responsive at 120 hertz with a 240hz touch sample rate but it is a slight step below the flagships visually and it maxes out at 800 nits when not showing hdr content which can get washed out in direct sunlight also the corner cutout for the selfie camera has this little ring around it that might be a little more distracting than some people might like also the speakers and small phones have never been great because physics and these aren't really an exception they're fine but they're semi-easily blocked and then probably the biggest thing i've noticed is this soft touch red color is very cool and i really like it but i am concerned about how this will wear you can see the edges and the corners of mine are already starting to fade and turn darker and the sunset red color is slightly less vibrant than it was when i first got the phone and this is only two weeks like i haven't really had the phone for that long so while i haven't seen a phone with quite this finish of plastic before i can't vouch for it aging well now just to get ahead of the comments that i can already see you typing yes most people just put a case on their phone already by default so it does actually come with this decidedly more plastic feeling case in the box but yeah i don't know i just i feel like a phone that has a soft touch plastic back shouldn't have to always have a case on it the way maybe a fragile glass one might so yeah that's something to know and then all the power button features i was just telling you about super first of all this is one of the fastest fingerprint readers in any phone you just graze it for a second and it unlocks super sensitive but then the pull down notification feature i was accidentally triggering all the time it kind of got annoying so i ended up turning it off because it was getting in the way kind of like i on the s10e i think i also disabled it so cool for a few days then i turned it off but yeah this power button this is something sustainability note this phone isn't particularly repairable but it does come in 100 fully recyclable packaging and it does come with 30 watt charging brick but yeah as far as downsides that's pretty much it i think i can confidently say this is the most well-rounded compact phone in the world if you can consider it compact i think there's a lot of really great things about this phone and i'm very happy to keep using it this is probably going to end up extremely underrated in the us because you don't really see zen phones in carrier stores so most people don't end up buying these but if you're looking around shopping for a great compact android phone around 700 bucks don't even think twice this is a great one to get yeah easy as that okay that's pretty much it thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace [Music] 
25,6pf2KJD5qf0,ROG Phone 5 Ultimate Review: The Most Ridiculous Custom!,2021-03-10T12:07:27Z,"{'viewCount': '2835005', 'likeCount': '119915', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '8337'}",[Music] this is what happens when you get to the limits of what any normal person would want in a phone and then just blow right past it [Music] hey what's up mkbhd here this is the rog phone 5 ultimate edition so there is no rg phone 4 for the same reason there was no one plus 4 4 is an unlucky number in some parts of asia so we've skipped right to five and this phone is every bit as ridiculous as it looks it's kind of funny they've actually sort of been toning down the gamer phone aesthetic over the years but they have not been toning down how ridiculous the actual phone is so gaming phones when they were starting out were never supposed to be reasonable you know they're huge phones with pretty striking designs rgb lights and the absolute bleeding edge maximum specs available and so the rog phone has been at the forefront of that for a while and this new one definitely takes it even further so first of all it's still got all the same big number fundamentals from before it is a massive phone it's got a gigantic 6.8 inch display 144hz ammo led a snapdragon triple eight which while it's not a plus version like they typically launch the phone with it is absolutely the latest and greatest right now still has a massive 6000 milliamp hour battery half a terabyte of ufs 3.1 and still has a huge pair of stereo front-facing speakers that get louder than any other phone i've tested in a long time but now on top of all that there's a lot of new there's a surprising amount of upgrades actually first of all you've probably noticed this back it's a matte white kind of a pearl like finish with blue accents it's not the grippiest thing in the world but it does reject fingerprints really well and overall the looks not too crazy it's still unmistakably an rog phone with those slanted lines and they just love printing text all over the phone so republic of gamer's logo the number five for rog phone five the quad bear camera text and at the top it says for those who dare for some reason they love that text but i do think the sim card tray in blue is a super nice touch and while the huge white phone still does stand out i do feel like the whole gamer phone aesthetic is maturing a little bit from just like rainbow puke now right in the middle and you might have caught that there is still a little bit of a glossy piece right there and you might be wondering what that is that is another screen on the back of this phone so it's called rog vision so there's this little inch and a half black and white screen that can display different kinds of information the settings for it here are in asus's armory crate app instead of in the settings app but once you dive in here you can turn the screen on and off and then choose what the screen lights up for so you can see it lights up when the phone's screen is on it lights up when the phone is charging it even lights up when you receive a phone call and then for each of these scenarios you can actually go in and customize the exact animations that play in each scenario to the point where you can actually create new animations and import images that you want to use and make new animations for yourself it's crazy now this is how i got the mkbhd text animation here playing on the back of my phone anytime my screen is on it's even orientation sensitive i know it's it's extra there's no other phone that does this and that's probably for reason but hey if you're gonna go niche you might as well go all the way down the customization rabbit hole and asus has like really committed to something unique here so okay there's no doubt they've leveled up the aesthetics it definitely still looks like a gamer phone but asus didn't just stop at the aesthetics so that's 6 000 milliamp hour battery i mentioned the one that won it the smartphone award for battery last year it's upgraded that to a fast charging system inside thanks to two things this really beefy heavy 65 watt charging brake that comes in the box and the new dual battery system inside so it's actually now a pair of 3000 milliamp hour batteries that charge in parallel so this is the same concept that oneplus was using with the 8t two smaller batteries in parallel charge faster than one huge one so now it's a massive best-in-class battery that also charges really fast roughly zero to seventy-five percent in around half an hour which is plenty now that's already great that's already i get a day and a half of completely carefree use out of this phone at 144 hertz which is crazy and if you want to take it easy set it to auto mode those numbers start to get kind of ridiculous at 60 hertz it's easily two days but the other thing to think about with a fast charging system like this is you still want to think about battery health long term and that's also something asus is thinking about so they've built in a bunch of different battery charging adjustments to address that so there's now steady charging which charges slower for better battery health there's scheduled charging so you can reduce the time that the battery is full and not in use so basically it slow charges overnight and then finishes up to 100 when it's time to get up and you can set that to finish charging depending on when your scheduled alarm is that is dope and you can also manually set a charging upper limit to just straight up limit your max charge to 80 or 90 and then on top of that there's something called bypass mode which is such it's such a gamer specific thing but when you're in this mode you plug in the phone let's say you're gaming it bypasses charging the battery and just puts the power straight into the system so that you're not heating up the battery as you're charging because you're not charging and you're not cycling the battery so it's just going straight into the actual system who would have thought it's a great idea so i'm clearly very impressed with the battery as you can probably tell but there's more first of all they brought the headphone jack back is this the first phone that i've seen that's ditched the headphone jack with one year's upgrade and then brought it back the next year i think so i think so they moved it from the phone in the rog phone 3 to the fan accessory through usb last year now it's back in the phone and not only is the headphone jack back but there's a dac behind it and there's a whole audio wizard built into the software that lets you drag 10 different frequency response sliders and change the audio in a crazy way like that's just that's approaching too much customization at this point it's awesome they've also technically leveled up the performance and the specs of the phone here too so imagine all the highest end specs possible that can fit in the phone snapdragon 8 chip check half a terabyte of the fastest ufs 3.1 storage check 18 gigs of ram on this highest end version check 144hz maximum refresh rate on the display with a 300 hertz touch sample rate check this is about as consistently smooth of a phone as you'll get to see like 18 gigs of ram in a phone is this some kind of joke like clearly i'm not the biggest gamer i don't really play games on my phone like that so i'm playing games to test this and it's obviously very responsive but the performance difference between this and something like a galaxy s 21 something with maybe 12 gigs of ram to be fair is pretty small so this is like i mentioned at the beginning the rog phone 5 ultimate edition which is the highest end in a new lineup of phones which i'll get to in a minute but this has 18 gigs and then the rest of the lineup gets up to 16 gigs so i feel like they added the extra two gigs of ram for this phone just for i mean it's gaming it's bragging rights yes it's technically better but i feel like they just want to be able to say they had the most ram in any phone which they can say now which is kind of sad because you can't actually pin apps into ram like you can on like samsung and oneplus phones would be nice to add on a phone like this right now one thing you probably didn't expect to be so good about a gaming phone is the cameras because they're usually pretty bad so this is an area where i was actually pleasantly surprised by rog phone five it has some decent cameras it's a triple camera set back here a 64 megapixel primary 13 megapixel ultra wide and a 5 megapixel macro camera and i wasn't expecting much like i said but the more photos i took with this primary camera the more impressed i was this thing makes some nice detailed pretty confident and contrasty photos it's the style that reminds me of the pixel it's not quite pixel level but it reminds me a lot of the zenfone also by asus which did win the blind smartphone camera test we did last year so this phone did a really good job maybe just a tiny bit aggressive with the hdr sometimes and i've noticed it's a little bit slow to focus on closer up objects so you can miss focus a bit but it's better than i expected from a gaming phone the ultra wide is definitely weaker and softer per usual and the macro it works but the minimum focus distance isn't as close as i'd expected from a macro and the selfie camera is wildly inconsistent with exposure so it's fine but you know even in the same room with back to back selfies i could get like totally different shots like i know you're probably not getting this phone just for the cameras but it's it's nice that it's not super disappointing so that's i would give it like a b minus in the grand world of smartphone cameras it's a b minus it's not bad the reason you would buy a phone like this is because of the power you get in the palm of your hands and the ridiculous level of customization possible you saw the audio customization behind the headphone jack you already saw the display on the back of this phone acting like a notification led on steroids even though this phone already has a notification led but then there's also these performance profiles and the armory crate that let you quickly flip over into a gaming mode or an everyday use mode or a battery saver mode and then all the custom settings that go with it and there's even the custom buttons did you even remember the custom buttons on this phone it's kind of a big deal there's a pair of the shoulder triggers called air triggers that are mappable and in addition there's a second set of back buttons and from my experience they're not as sensitive but they do work by just kind of sliding your finger over them honestly i don't even know what games i would play that are serious enough to take advantage of these but if you do that's two more extra buttons on the back of this phone so you don't have to cover that precious screen real estate with your fingers it's crazy stuff and on top of all of that like i said it feels like uh like like a sports car that you can also drive on the daily and i say that because zen ui feels pretty close to stock android like they've built a lot of the features directly into the settings without turning it into some blinged out over-the-top gamer-y look i mean it can be that when you want it to but if you're not it's a very usable daily phone now i've said a lot of good things in the past however many minutes this has been so far now if you're thinking well what's the catch what are the bad parts of this phone there's got to be stuff that's not perfect and there is definitely i would say a bunch of it adds up to feeling a little bit less premium than the highest end phones in this price bracket and maybe that's because i've just used some of the other ones recently but there's some stuff to note like the vibration motor and the haptics aren't great at all and in a gaming phone actually i would expect this to be a pretty heavy focus like having great haptics and a gaming phone for immersion sake would feel really cool this is maybe one notch better than the classic old vibration motors of the past it's nowhere near the best doesn't feel very precise or tight at all the fingerprint reader is slow like there's no way around it i guess if i'm sticking with my car analogy that would be like taking a long time to turn on i don't know it just gets annoying after a while when it is slow to unlock a lot and then the display while it is super responsive we know the 144 hertz is great it's still slightly below a1 quality like there's a bit of the telltale rainbowing when you're off axis and while the max brightness did improve it can't still get washed out in harsh sun there's no wireless charging call quality is definitely not that great and the rubber plug on the side usb ports falls out really easily and they definitely know this because they included two extra ones in the box but i'm convinced i'm gonna lose them all and also fun fact we did manage to kill this phone to zero percent battery and when we did it wouldn't charge back up until we plugged it in the side usb port which asus tells us is the primary usb port asus also tells us that this will be fixed with an upcoming software update so it's not perfect like there's there's definitely stuff that's quirky about it but the thing is i think the easy complaint about a phone like this is that is a giant clunky form factor with like kind of thick bezels why wouldn't you go closer to the edge and do a hole punch but on a gaming phone if the idea is to be here all the time and not interrupt your view with a hole punch then having a little extra on the side to hold it and having huge front-facing stereo speakers is a trade-off that i think makes a lot of sense so overall this is a really fun ridiculous phone so now that you've made it all the way to the end of this video i'm assuming you have like at least a tiny little bit of interest in buying this right so this phone this rog 5 ultimate edition highest 10 spec is uh 1299 euros there's a little bit of conversion math depending on where you are in the world but that's expensive now this ultimate edition includes the phone and also this incredibly extra ar unboxing experience that the phone boots into the first time you set it up it's pretty cool and there's a fan accessory and there's some asus gamery swag like a hat there is like i mentioned though a lineup so this is the ultimate the highest end version 12.99 then there is a rog phone 5 pro for 11.99 and there's this guy which is just the standard rog phone 5 which starts at 7.99 big difference uh it skips the screen on the back and it doesn't have the two touch sensitive back buttons and it starts at eight gigs of ram and 128 gigs of storage and so if you're thinking about getting one the base version i feel like is the most reasonable and then i think when you upgrade for an extra 100 euro that first upgrade is pretty nice double the storage bump up your ram but then this spec right here i think is a little crazy a hundred extra dollars for just four more gigs of ram which i don't know i feel like that's not the move but then the price only goes up from here as you upgrade further in the lineup but hey you know what they say you gotta pay to play do they actually say that i don't know i'm just look i only play among us on my phone i feel like at this point there are people who are more squarely in the target demographic who are thinking about shooter games first person whatever other games you play that require multiple custom buttons this is a phone that's going to be really fun for that but let me know what you think are you the type to go all out on a crazy customized gaming phone like this with a screen on the back the whole deal let me know in the comments section below also the wallpaper i'll link below as i always do and yes by the way we do have long sleeve shirts in the merch store shop item kbht.com it's good stuff either way that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music] 
26,OkLOJapGjC4,The ROG Phone 7 Ultimate is Just Ridiculous!,2023-04-13T12:30:43Z,"{'viewCount': '2199571', 'likeCount': '76975', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '4017'}",[Music] all right what can I say gaming phones have come a long way since they first started coming out a few years ago not just because there's more gaming phones and that's more competition but also just because regular Flagship phones now have insane Hardware too but still at the top of the Heap for gaming phones sits this guy the Asus Rog Phone 7 Ultimate let's just start with just the numbers okay numbers on paper Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 at 3.2 gigahertz with the adreno 740 GPU 16 gigs of lpddr5x RAM half a terabyte of ufs 4.0 storage a 6.78 inch 1080p AMOLED display at 165 Hertz up to 1200 nits a 6 000 milliamp hour battery with 65 watt charging and two usb-c ports plus a headphone jack kind of sounds like it has everything because it nearly does but I actually do want to start with the one thing that it doesn't have which is a a world-class camera system but the thing is I mean that's probably fine it is a gaming phone after all now obviously it's still expensive so you don't want to feel like you're getting a bad camera but let's be real the camera is not the priority in these phones or for the people buying these phones so I mean really the objective is to give you a good enough camera system that you're not mad but it's not going to be a good enough camera that you're out bragging about it so this is a 50 megapixel primary camera that bends to 12 and a half megapixels and can do that lossless 2x zoom and then there is a 13 18 megapixel Ultra wide and that third camera is a 5 megapixel macro so not a telephoto it's all fine right it's a it's a pretty classic like daylight shots decent lighting is fine and then as soon as the lighting conditions deteriorate so do the photos and videos you get a lot of noise pretty quickly I still got to give props to Asus for doing a pretty great job with HDR though and getting a good amount of detail out of most normal shots and they've actually even added some pretty clever features to their default camera app and I don't think of Asus phones usually as like the best cameras ever but there's the pro photo and video modes that are getting you a few new features to play with that are just like fun to use so combined with the 32 megapixel selfie camera I feel like I can confidently give this whole camera Suite like a b it's definitely not bad it's just it's not why you buy this phone I mean if you're looking for the reason you buy this phone look no further than the design because that says everything you need to know this is the Phantom white finish on the back here still the this year it's a combination of satin white and I guess a different satin white maybe matte white but it still has the text everywhere Rog O7 Republic of Gamers 206 8K Ultra HD the ultimate version still has this display on the back which you can't even see while you're using the phone but it will display to the people around you either in animation or some information in a scrolling Banner or when it's face down and charging you can see your percentage things like that you can't have too big of a camera up like you have these gigantic camera Rings now and a lot of these Flagship phones you can't do that on this phone because it's supposed to be perfectly balanced for when you're you're gaming and holding it in landscape mode and so that's why you have that split battery design 3000 milliamp hours over here 3000 more milliamp hours over here and actually the motherboard is in the middle which is a pretty clever design and so now it's perfectly balanced as all things should be now like I said gaming phone right so we have these awesome Flagship phones s23 Ultra Oppo Find X6 Pro they also have incredible numbers and specs but this one separates itself by leaning a little bit more towards gaming and media and that experience not that those aren't good at gaming in media but well gaming is Media so the things that this does to be good at gaming are great at that and watching videos and just sort of scrolling around using a phone like normal so that's why you end up with not just 120 hertz ltpo but a Samsung built flat 165 Hertz OLED with a 720 Hertz touch sample rate and a 23 millisecond touch latency it's once again the most responsive and smoothest display I've ever used in a phone my eye can actually tell the difference between this and 120hz display and a lot of the other flagships out right now which is awesome so that's of course going to be great for gaming getting every single last frame out of the games that actually support that but also that's pretty nice for just scrolling around and flipping through apps and social media too this split battery setup they've got going on they've been doing that for a couple years too 3 000 plus 3000 is a 6 000 milliamp hour battery and that actually allows them to fast charge them in parallel so you get 65 Watts going into the phone it'll charge from zero to 100 in like 45 minutes which is already 10 minutes faster than last year's phone and they even have this graphic uh that they sent me showing the standard batteries need a thin separator while fast charging battery is made a thicker separator because they push more current and it's just safer to do it this way sounds like this would be a trade-off that you have to think really hard about in any other phone except it doesn't matter in this phone because the whole phone is thick it's thick enough to handle a gigantic battery and fast charging I mean that's that's at least three C's you know plus there's a whole Suite of battery management features that make this thing last forever I mean it's already a battery champ easily pulling seven hours of screen on time at 165 Hertz but there's also scheduled charging there's also study charging so it doesn't fast charge every time you plug it in if you don't want it to there's also custom charging limits there's also pass-through charging there is no wireless charging but there are two USBC ports as I mentioned one on the bottom and one on the side no it doesn't charge twice as fast if you plug in both the same time I tried that's still the Legion phone dual little trick but uh interestingly the the side USB port is actually considered the primary one that's the faster USB 3.1 data speeds so either way if you plug in you can get the fast charging but if you want to plug in any accessories or anything like that that will go into that side port here but speaking of accessories this is this is probably all you need to know about how ridiculous this phone is and who it's targeted for so this thing this is the Aero active cooler 7. so this is a clip-on plug in active cooling accessory that you plug into and connect to the back of the phone that has a heatsink fan RGB lights inside and this little uh this black tab on the on the side of this Rog phone is actually an opening it motorizes and opens up so you clamp on this cooler over the side of the phone just like this plug it in by the USB on the side and the fan starts spinning up and then this black like lift gate over here on the side of the phone opens up to allow active airflow through the side of the phone it's opening up the phone and spinning in that cool air so when you're gaming this will help bring down the back cover Surface by as much as 20 to 25 degrees Celsius according to Asus Labs but there's also like there's four trigger buttons back here there's RGB lights that change and breathe depending on what you're doing and there's a whole subwoofer for enhanced bass and it actually works [Music] [Applause] [Music] there is a genuine Improvement in the sound quality when listening to it with the subwoofer on the back of the phone and the front-facing speakers combined you never expect these things to be as good as they are but just the whole thing just this this whole dedication to building something that is going to take a few degrees off your your phone and give you a couple extra frames their dedication to that gamer is impressive it literally opens up the back of the phone and by the way you can take this off and it closes that port on the back and it's still ip54 water resistant when it's closed this one feels like a sports car where a lot of the ridiculous specialized Tech is completely unnecessary to most people but it'll eventually trickle down into everyday cars like most regular cars slash phones don't need this crazy moving part and active aerodynamics they don't need extra RAM and extra power but eventually eventually regular Flagship phones in a few years will have all of this power and all of this Cooling and all the capabilities of this phone they'll just be normal phones so make sure you subscribe to see the reviews of those phones when they come out but for now this is this is still going to separate itself as a phone for the gamer especially just because of the way it's built obviously it's thicker than a normal phone but they they still have things like bezels on the front for your thumbs and the front-facing speakers so you can hold it like this and have a place when you're gaming to rest your fingers that's something most phones aren't going to do anymore the X report of course and the compatibility with the crazy accessories and just their willingness to just use like basic off-the-shelf parts for the things that don't really matter so much like sure this Optical fingerprint reader it's fine it's totally normal the cameras as well like I said you don't get a telephoto camera you just get like an off-the-shelf B plus b camera system fine but when it comes to anything that a gamer could possibly want to get that last one or two fps to get that last second off of your lap time or that last kill or to be able to have that little bit of an advantage they'll throw the kitchen sink at it they'll do all the software features in the world and Hardware stuff to make that happen and I respect that there's no way I could go through all those things in this single video but I respect that a lot here are some of my personal favorites there is a new Vapor chamber cooling system inside of this phone that you'll never see but the new y-shaped Wick columns with larger radii give a 168 percent Improvement to Thermal efficiency according to asus's testing the custom mappable air triggers built into the top corners of this phone have been improved for better sensitivity and they can be custom mapped for all kinds of stuff even outside of games and this phone has Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 support even though none of our routers really do yet this is a really impressive purpose-built machine through and through I'm glad they made it and uh yeah gaming phones of today walk so that flagships of Tomorrow can run thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music] 
27,IEwEDTmqCEs,Asus ROG Phone 3 Review: The Spec King Returns!,2020-07-22T15:29:54Z,"{'viewCount': '3533065', 'likeCount': '119817', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '9001'}",[Music] what's up guys mkbhd here so i don't know if you remember but the winningest phone of my smartphone awards last year was the asus rog phone 2 the spec king so that thing won the best big phone of the year that had the best battery life of the year and won the most improved award so how do they follow it up with this this is the asus rog phone three so i've been using and testing this phone alongside the oneplus nord for a couple weeks now and basically what you need to know is it follows very closely in a lot of the same footsteps as rog phone 2 similar design and specs and choices but just bumped up a notch for 2020 and really there are two incredible things about this phone that continue to stick out and that is the battery and the specs so this design as you can see it's kind of funny when i first saw it i was like oh no wait they're toning it down even more remember the first rog phone was totally wild the second rog phone was a little toned down from that and so i saw this third one and i got a little afraid they might have started neutering the whole gaming aesthetic to make it more of an everyday phone but as soon as you pick it up you quickly realize oh just kidding this is absolutely 100 still a super unique design that they've committed to for this phone it's still got the rgb lit logo at the back that can glow for notifications still got the traced lines and the little exposed slot for the heat sink and the carbon chamber cooling system on the side still has the custom mappable air triggers on the side which improved actually this year with better sensitivity and precision and more custom mapping options and it still has even the offset usb-c port on the bottom so you can charge while gaming and the cable doesn't get in the way and really above all it's still absolutely huge it's just so massive this is this is actually i think too big a phone for me to want to carry it daily and i really don't say that much i think this this phone finally found that point for me somewhere between the biggest flagships of samsung and oneplus we arrived at this and i think it's the gigantic footprint that makes it too big but you all know what it did win the best big phone of the year for a reason and a lot of that was how well they use all this space so they kept the stereo front-facing speakers in this phone and they are actually incredible the stereo image they produce and the volume they achieve thanks to having all this space is second to none some of the absolute best speakers i've heard in a phone the only thing is the volume curve i found kind of weird like they really don't start getting loud until you're at like 80 volume but that's not a huge deal they can honestly fix that quickly with a software update now again that predecessor the rog phone 2 was that do everything in one package phone and this is still an incredible spec sheet and we'll get to that in a second but it does have a few things notably missing this year first of all it doesn't have a headphone jack built in on the rog phone 3. there's also no official ip dust or water resistance rating and there's also no wireless charging probably because they really wanted to keep that rgb glowing logo on the back now the headphone jack i was a little confused by because it's a gaming phone and you would still think someone who wants zero lag will accept nothing less than wired audio but it also does come in the box with this little accessory that gives you usbc and a headphone jack on the side so i guess it kind of makes up for it but i do miss wireless charging in a phone that i use every day just because at this point most phones i use and test have wireless charging i have wireless chargers everywhere so i do miss that all right have a look at this spec sheet just just look at it i mean is there a single thing on this list that isn't absolutely bleeding edge top of the line it's got the new snapdragon 865 plus that's just starting to show up in phones now by the way that chip is clocked at up to 3.1 gigahertz in a phone 16 gigs of ram it's a 1080p 144 hertz oled display up to half a terabyte of ufs 3.1 storage and a 6 000 milliamp hour battery every single one of those numbers is is the biggest or the highest you can basically find or put in a phone it's all top shelf parts but something that i think a lot of people forget is you also have to consider the best way to transition from all those big numbers to actual user experience is great software and asus software it's okay to me it's getting better but it's definitely not perfect really there's a lot of subtle things like animations and unlocking and transitions and just occasional places in the ui where it hiccups just a tiny bit and i notice it now that's just me and a lot of people haven't used a bunch of other high-end high refresh rate phones they may never notice this stuff but most of the time this phone is super smooth right up next to the other 144hz phone i've used as the smoothest phone i've ever tested so that's worth noting and overall performance as you would expect from that spec sheet has been great and yes i did leave on 144 hertz maxed out all the time because there really isn't much of a downside right you can this phone is going to let you go between 60 90 120 and 144 hertz i'll leave it maxed out because you can't really hurt the battery much it's so huge and it's only a 1080p screen so the specs can clearly handle it so yeah i paid for all the hurts might as well use them but let's talk about that battery so this phone again has a 6 000 milliamp hour battery which is again the biggest battery i've ever used in a phone plus this year there's also 30 watt fast charging supported and you guys already know i've tested many other big phones in the past thick boys like this and none of them have actually gotten me through two days you know some of them get to the end of the day with like 40 left some of them will get a whole day and a half but none of them have actually really gotten me a comfortable two days but i was i was testing this a little while back and sure enough i had a pretty light day and i actually ended a day with 52 battery left at like 10 30 p.m and when i saw that i was like wow i'm ending the day with more than half my battery let's just try it let's just see if i can go a full two days on this phone so i didn't charge it i woke up the next day and i went through an entire new day and i got to the end of that day i think at 9 30 p.m i had three percent battery lift and it was about six hours of screen on time so there was some gaming and some navigation but two light days in a row i made it to the end of the second day at 144 hertz that is incredibly impressive again i mean i expect nothing less from a just a huge battery like that but two full days of light use easily over a day of heavy use at 144 hertz dude if you put this down to like 60 or 90 hertz just because you have a long time where you're not gonna be able to plug in this is a legit two day phone and icing on the cake is the fast charging too so 30 watts it might not seem super fast but just think about this when you're quick charging you get the fastest charging speeds from about 0 to 60 65 before it levels off and you get closer to full that's how batteries work well when you're charging on this phone with this huge battery the quick couple minutes of charge from zero to sixty five percent just got you four thousand milliamp hours so charging is fast the battery lasts forever you can use less charge cycles so the battery stays healthy for longer it's just all great and honestly it's probably a lock again for the battery award this year okay you got triple cameras on the back um we all know we're not buying a gaming phone for the cameras none of them in the past have had a good reputation for cameras but didn't stop me from testing it and my findings lined up probably exactly what you'd expect pretty mediocre set of cameras so you have a 64 megapixel main camera it's a big number and then a 13 megapixel ultra wide and a 5 megapixel macro camera to me this macro camera in a gaming phone is the perfect example of just adding the cheapest extra camera to just be able to say you have triple cameras but honestly i really don't think people are looking to just buy the phone with more cameras dear smartphone manufacturers if you have the choice between adding a bad macro camera or one that people won't very often use or just not adding it you can just not add it so shots from the main camera are passable when you give it enough light so daytime shots are fine but as soon as you get into those tougher situations like with higher dynamic range or just low light in general they definitely fall apart and the ultra wide and macro are just much softer no matter how good the light is i mean they did their job the ultrawide is definitely very wide it's 125 degrees and the macro lens does in fact close focus but let's not get carried away people aren't buying this phone for the cameras i'm actually more confused why there's still a camera bump on the back of the phone at all on maybe the thickest flagship phone of the year surely they could have fit the cameras into the chassis with no bump but i guess not all these features and all these specs packed into this phone had me reconsidering like the original question when we first started getting these gaming phones which is does it make sense to make to buy a gaming phone and i think the answer for a really small group of people is yes people that play a lot of well-optimized games on their phone and want the best possible experience for that will enjoy this phone and things like air triggers and the faster refresh rate and the snappier response time of the display and the gaming specific features like x mode that throttles up the cpu and game genie that lets you you know feature hub for stuff like recording the screen and silencing notifications and clearing out ram for a little bit of extra performance all that stuff for that tiny group of people sure but for the rest of us these really just end up being glorified or really nice media machines media consumption phones big screen big speakers big battery high refresh like watching videos scrolling instagram like this is an amazing phone for that and that's fine too but for those who really know what they're getting into rog phone 3 is a beast of a phone so that's been it thanks for watching and thanks to expressvpn for sponsoring this video so in a previous video i mentioned that expressvpn is more trustworthy because they run their servers in ram but what does that actually mean well when you use the internet like normal your isp your internet service provider so comcast verizon whoever it is routes your data to whatever sites you're visiting but see the problem is because all that information is going through your isp every time and they can store logs on all that stuff in the us they're legally allowed to sell that data but when you're using expressvpn you're rerouting your traffic through the expressvpn encrypted servers so the isp can only see that you're communicating with the vpn server and not any of the websites you're visiting or what you're doing online now you might be thinking that's nice but now the vpn can just log all of what i'm doing online and that's smart to think many vpns claim to have a no log policy but expressvpn's trusted server technology means they're the first vpn to engineer all their servers to only run in ram so they can't retain logs even by accident because the machines reset on every reboot and expressvpn is so confident in their no logs claim that they've even had pwc come in and audit their technology so it's kind of a no-brainer for all of us to be using expressvpn so if you haven't gotten on the train yet you can join the link is in the description expressvpn.com mkbhd will get you an extra three months free so there you go a little extra for you thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace 
28,FrgGHAab9D8,OnePlus One Review!,2014-05-20T03:28:12Z,"{'viewCount': '3303172', 'likeCount': '64113', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '7520'}",hey what is up guys mkbhd here and this is the oneplus one it's a new phone from a new manufacturer and it's gotten a lot of attention it's actually one of the most polarizing phones i have ever seen so over in the tech community this phone is almost impossible to get people are swarming over this phone there's way more demand than supply there's an invite system it's just really really hard to get your hands on but then i go over to class and someone says hey what phone is that and i say it's the oneplus one and they go the what i don't i don't really know what that is so clearly there's a big divide over who cares about this phone why the short answer to that question is the price this phone when it's available will cost outright three hundred dollars for the phone off contract for perspective the iphone 5s will retail seven hundred dollars off contract the galaxy s5 700 off contract the htc one seven hundred dollars off contract so when you put up a phone with very similar specs to that and it costs only 250 off contract it's turn a lot of heads in the tech community and that's because we care about specs so let's try to find out if this is worth caring about the specs for this low of a price so just to get it out the way it is rocking a 2.5 gigahertz quad-core snapdragon 801 chip the adreno 330 gpu three gigabytes of ram a 13 megapixel camera a 3 100 milliamp hour battery all very similar specs to something like the samsung galaxy s5 and on top of all that for a premium slab style phone the oneplus one is built really well i actually think its design is one of its best assets so this white version here is extremely soft to the touch and they advertise that a lot it's super soft and yet it's also very durable it feels really solid in the hand thanks to all the metal involved around the frame so all the way around the phone no matter how you hold it you're touching metal somewhere and it really does actually have the perfect button placement for a big phone yes it's big it's that 5.5 inch 1080p display but the power button is low enough on that right hand side and the volume buttons are low enough that it shows that they actually took some notes they actually thought about where to put these buttons and it keeps the phone pretty usable to even someone with smaller hands uh more comparable to the smaller five inch or 5.1 inch display flagships it's also pretty thin so really the design is one of the best points about the oneplus one so with the beastly specs and pretty top-notch build quality it seems like you're getting a lot for your money for this phone and it certainly feels like it when you're holding it again it feels like a beast of a phone uh you also have lte 802.11 ac wi-fi a big battery too like i said 3 100 milliamp hours but it's not removable although you can take off the back and soon you'll be able to replace the back with other covers of different materials and i also noticed that this phone has three microphones one on top one on the back and one on the bottom leading me to believe the audio quality would be great and it was and calls but for some reason the call volume of the person i was talking to was super low like i cranked the volume and i could barely hear who i was talking to which was weird but i guess that can be fixed with a software update but for other apps the speaker sounded just fine maybe even a bit above average since it's real stereo instead of fake stereo like the iphone or the nexus 5. so if you've been looking really hard for a flaw that makes this phone's hardware worth really less than the other 700 flagships it's trying to kill you probably haven't found it yet and neither have i i mean i've been using the phone for weeks as far as i can tell this phone is pretty much flawless a miracle piece of hardware for the price and i've been damn impressed with using it but really guys this phone is super similar on the inside to a lot of those other 700 phones thanks to the specs inside so what really differentiates it what really makes this a different phone is actually the software uh it's cyanogenmod and like i said in that top five video i did not too long ago for all intents and purposes this is a cyanogenmod phone this is going to depend on the features and the awesome stuff that comes with cyanogenmod 11s so it's a custom built os for this phone based on the latest version of android 4.4 kitkat and it's definitely filled with extra features specifically for this hardware which is nice to see i've talked about some of their stuff before so it lets you choose a lot of things to really customize your vanilla android like experience so you can really make it your own you can make it seem very much like a nexus almost stock like me or you can hop in the theme manager and really go crazy all out customizing not just your wallpaper and your icons but your boot animation and your lock screen and everything all sorts of stuff and there are custom features like being able to choose between on-screen software buttons or off-screen capacitive buttons depending on what you like you can't do that on any other phone you can also customize what the software buttons show up by adding or subtracting or reordering them however you like so there's tons of stuff here that you'd probably be used to finding in a custom rom because really that's what this is it's cyanogenmod even though this device is not rooted out the box another cyan engine mod feature is you can say hey snapdragon snapdragon hey snapdragon hey snapdragon and sometimes it decides to wait and work and other times it doesn't uh when you do it opens up google now and you have to train your voice for a while i haven't found this to be really all that responsive but like you just saw it does work sometimes they've also custom built a lock screen so it blurs your wallpaper or since it's android 4.4 will also blur whatever album art of whatever music you're listening to while it's playing which is really cool and i'm actually a pretty big fan of this lock screen just because it's a big screen and not everyone can reach the center with one finger so just swiping down from anywhere in the middle is pretty convenient if you're trying to use the device with one hand and of course you can always swipe to get into the camera directly from the lock screen as well and they've custom built a few other apps like the audio effects control which works really well for listening to music the themes browser again like we mentioned the gallery and the camera app so this is a custom built one by cyanogen again it's kind of a cross between the old google camera and the new one but i do like how easy it is to switch between shooting modes they made it really easy here just a vertical swipe up or down to move between modes so i actually found myself using this a lot just to quickly switch to hdr real quick i used to use it all the time just because of how easy it was and the camera itself on the phone was surprisingly nice to me like i've heard some other people didn't really like it that much but i think it's pretty good certainly better than the google play edition 1m8 i'm coming from so it takes 13 megapixel photos and it's capable of 4k or slow motion video and i'm actually a fan of how low profile the physical camera itself is people don't really talk about it that much but it reminds me a lot of the oppo find 7 here which is probably the phone that this is physically most similar to and it sticks out just a tiny little bit but i say good job to them on keeping the camera pretty small and low profile and the actual pictures it takes look pretty nice so there's no optical image stabilization but it does have dual led flash and multiple lenses and everything else you'd expect from a nice camera and the photos were detailed and saturated and well colored and sharp i actually like the action mode because it forces a faster shutter speed which freezes stuff at the expense of a bit of a higher iso but it does reduce blur really well so it almost kind of makes up for that lack of stabilization low light pictures again were okay compared to other decent phones i mean this is a solid camera i mentioned in my find 7a review that i'm a fan of the slightly over aggressive hdr and we see it again here almost the exact same way i mean this one plus one camera is where i was probably fully expecting to be let down by the price tag but nope gets a thumbs up for me here so the only real con here in this phone is cyanogenmods bugs which is good and bad bad because it's the whole os and it's a custom os built for the phone so you'd expect it to be perfect i guess but it's also good because even though it's not perfect it can be fixed with software updates so during my use of this phone i kept coming across little force closes and little errors that i just don't normally see on other phones and a lot of them were easily reproducible for example if you open up the camera app directly from the lock screen then hit the kind of invisible home button your wallpaper will glitch a bit and black out the bottom part and will not fix itself until you sleep the phone and then wake it again where the bottom part of the wallpaper reappears kind of weird but happens every time little stuff like that regular performance you know zipping around the phone and multitasking is just fine opening and closing apps animations frame rates are all high even gaming is pretty great i've played a couple of games on this phone i'm not a big gamer on my phone but it's it seems solid but this is where it really gets weird really almost all of the other animations throughout the os are fast except for the home button now of course i have on-screen buttons but i tried this with the off-screen buttons too and i got the same issue the home button response time is super slow a lot of you guys mentioned this in the top five video like what is that lag coming from uh it's not really a lag it's just a palpable delay a delay between hitting the home button and then actually starting the animation to go home it's so big of a delay that a lot of us notice it every time and it got annoying for me so i actually put it up next to the google play edition 1m8 like just to make sure i wasn't going crazy and sure enough yeah it's got some serious delay and i don't know why the other buttons don't have a delay the back button is actually faster and the multitasking button works just fine so i thought it was waiting for a home double tap to see if i was sleeping the screen but i turned that option off so i really have no explanation for this massive intrusive delay for the home button and i can only hope cyanogen already knows about this issue and is working to fix it with a quick over-the-air software update so that's kind of the story of using this phone i love the hardware and using it and everything it just doesn't feel quite as polished as a nexus or another high-end flagship when i'm using it and that's evident by the little software problems here and there the occasional delays and force closes when working around and trying to use all the awesome features of this custom operating system so at the end of the day yeah this phone comes down to signage and modern whether or not cyanogen can keep improving and keep sending updates to this phone i've already gotten one in the time i've spent with it and whether or not they can live up to these specs because i would really expect a phone with such awesome specs like this to perform kind of like a 700 phone i'm not expecting it to match every part of that phone but i expected a custom os for a brand new company's phone to to at least perform optimally on it so really this phone is going to live or die on cyanogenmod and whether or not the updates come and keep it stable like it would on a nexus because you can already expect that to happen on a nexus so yeah this is a really impressive phone i am i am really big fan of the hardware i like how soft the back is i like how sturdy it's built i like the specs i like the way it looks it is a big phone but i have big hands i don't mind that and i can understand why people are clamoring over this phone especially in the tech community i don't think you should smash a 700 phone to get it but hey marketing is marketing and this is a pretty well priced phone for what you're getting for the money so i say if you're willing to take that risk in cyanogen mod and you think they're going to actually maintain it and update it like a nexus is pretty much guaranteed to be from google and you want that experience for a hundred bucks off it might just be a damn good deal for the risk you're taking so if you trust them do it it's gonna be worth it i don't have any invites i can't get you an invite if you're trying to get this phone i'll keep you guys updated on twitter of course in the link right below that like button for availability and things like that if you're trying to get your hands on it but uh for now there might be a giveaway coming up maybe soon but really the idea here is uh if you're trusting cyanogenmod it's a pretty good pick so there you go guys thanks for watching this review video hope you enjoyed it again there's a thumbs up button below to click if you liked it and i will talk to you guys in the next video peace you

29,s8Un0XB_8xk,OnePlus 2 Review!,2015-08-29T03:12:37Z,"{'viewCount': '3363843', 'likeCount': '52218', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '5658'}",hey what is up guys um could be HD here and this is the oneplus 2 company named oneplus phone name the 2 1+2 1+2 so i've been using this device for the better part of a month about three weeks or so as my daily driver so all the time and I know a lot of people get worked up over the flagship killer slogan that they use what I'm just going to do is ignore all the hype and just look at the device itself so the easiest place to start is the hardware and a lot of interesting decisions went into the hardware department for the oneplus 2 but they all came together to equal a really nice phone that feels good in the hand and that's what's important so it has a nice little weight to it it's a little on the bigger side of the scale as far as smartphones go but it's nothing too extreme since it's definitely not the biggest smartphone with a 5.5 inch display the metal band around the phone is really premium it's a huge improvement over the oneplus one and it's this metal band alone that makes the phone feel like it's more expensive and I like if they didn't try to go super thin like some manufacturers trying to one-up themselves I guess but nothing wrong with being a little thick dear every smartphone manufacturer ever if you're using a large camera module which you probably are feel free to fill out the rest of the phone's body with battery like this it will not make the phone too heavy or too thick and everyone will appreciate the extra battery thank you anyway the shape with the oneplus 2 is just fine it's rectangular and sort of boxy in a way but it fits in the hand nicely and this phone is really easy to hold the sandstone black back helps that too now every one plus two comes by default with this sandstone black back and the texture is pretty unique it's a little bit rougher than last year's phone I'm guessing for durability but it still feels great and then the back is removable so you can buy another back with a different material and drop that on for a different look and feel also with the removable back you get access to the dual SIM card slot trays no I access to the battery or any expandable storage but you do just get the SIM card slots now this one also features a pretty unique switch on the left hand side it's the alert slider so you can switch between sound profiles on the phone without having to turn the screen on so all the way down is all notifications half way up is priority notifications and all the way up is do not disturb mode pretty nifty switch although I feel like this is upside down if I wanted to flip all the way to silent I feel like I would switch all the way down I don't know I wish I could reverse the order in the settings now of course this slider on the left means you have both your power and volume buttons on the right hand side of the phone this was a little bit annoying at first neither one of them has ridges or anything so you kind of just have to remember where the power button is and you get used to it eventually they're pretty clicky tactile buttons but it took about a week of using the phone to get it to feel natural and stop making mistakes I pretty much hit the power button on the first try every time now although there's also totally the option of the double tap on the screen to wake from sleep if you want to use that now at the top of the phone is the headphone jack I kind of wish it was at the bottom but oh well and then at the bottom of the phone you have the speakers and the USB type-c port now the speakers aren't anything special it's not even a stereo speaker all the audio comes from the right Grill which is not very loud and it's kind of easy to cover with your finger it has these built-in audio profiles which are nice if you really want to tweak the EQs but honestly the quality of the driver has to be decent first I'll end up cupping your hand around that to hear it anyway this is one of those spots where they're cutting corners and then there's a USB type-c port alright so this is a new port for smartphones and it was given in this phone with the reasoning this is the future and it totally is but that means that here in the present it's actually a little bit inconvenient unless you have a 2015 MacBook or Chromebook pixel you don't really have a bunch of USB type-c charges lying around and the one that comes on the box the cable is a little bit short and you have to buy another one for your car and and I don't know is it really worth it here's USB type-c in this phone broken down here are your pros and here are your cons is a worth it depends on how into the future you are I kind of miss fast charging but the battery life here is good enough that I'm not charging in the middle of the day so I'm down with it the oneplus 2 also has a biometric fingerprint sensor in that home button and as I mentioned in the original impressions video that I did when the phone first came out this home button does all the same stuff a regular home button does except actually press down and move it's not tactile so it's basically like a trackpad a glass surface that you can tap double tap or hold down to read your fingerprint and the fingerprint reading is pretty good now this phone has gotten I think for software updates since I first started using it and from the very beginning the fingerprint sensor was quick and it's only gotten quicker I'm really happy with it it unlocks my phone with pretty great accuracy you can store up to 5 fingers if you want and it's an easy way to secure my phone I find it to be just as accurate as touch ID all right so fun fact when oneplus first sent me this phone early before the launch day for that impressions video you guys saw they didn't tell me anything about the phone they didn't tell me any of the specs they didn't tell me any numbers so I actually wanted to play a little game with myself I just looked at the display and I wanted to see if I could figure out if it's a 1080p display or a quad HD display just by looking at it and I looked at it I set my wallpaper I got my icons and everything and I guessed based on you know looks pretty good I'm gonna say that's a top notch yeah that's that's a quad HD display of course I took a screenshot and I looked at it later and it's 1080p so I got the idea and I you know I held it up to a Galaxy s6 and then of course you can tell oh that looks way better with the AMOLED display and quad HD on the galaxy s6 but the point is this is a great 1080p display one of the best in the business and that's pretty good for 2015 so there you have it just on the outside this phone is kind of stacked in the hardware department it's at 5.5 inch 1080p display its excellent has great viewing angles excellent brightness contrast and colors thin bezels to keep the footprint pretty manageable metal rails the swappable sandstone back dual SIM card slots a 13 megapixel camera with autofocus laser autofocus which I'll talk about in a second at 3300 milliamp hour battery a fingerprint reader and alert slider a USB type-c port that's a lot of great stuff but like I mentioned in that perfect smartphone video the last video we tend to now measure smartphones by what's wrong with them instead of what's right so the worst parts about this hardware would be the weak speaker and the lack of wireless charging and NFC now on the weak speaker not a whole lot you can do you can just set the EQ still it sounds good enough to your ear and it just won't be very loud and the wireless charging also not a huge deal for me if you can pick up a few USB type-c cables you'll pretty much be good to charge wherever you want no NFC though there's really no workaround for that and there's two types of people on that issue number one people who use NFC all the time people who use mobile payments Google Wallet for that type of person this is a deal breaker this is not the phone for you if you're the other type of person like me where you don't use NFC all that often I mean I used it actually once in a while to pair with my rx100 to wirelessly transfer photos not a huge deal it takes a little longer to do Wi-Fi pairing now but for that it's not really a big deal oneplus is argument is that there are more of that second type of person so they decided not to include it but I mean how cheap would it have really been I mean not including a super cheap feature like NFC and a new smartphone because people don't use it is kind of like building a car and not including reverse lights because people usually drive forward technically true but evade come on now the camera on the back of the oneplus 2 I did an entire separate video about that was when I first got the phone a few weeks ago and I'll link that video right below that like button I can pair it at length to a couple of other high-end smartphones and give some photo and video quality samples basically it's a pretty good quality smartphone camera that's capable of taking some great shots but it's a little slow and it needs to continue to be improved with software updates it's a 13 megapixel omni vision pure cell s image sensor the largest pixel size of any 13 megapixel camera and it has optical image stabilization and laser autofocus the laser autofocus is very fast as you'd expect and the optical image stabilization for photos is very good it takes some crispy low-light shots with a low slow shutter speed handheld so that's awesome but it's kind of slow to actually take the shot getting the camera app open is pretty quick I've been mapped to a double press of the home button just like a Samsung phone so I don't need any camera shortcut on my home screen but the time it actually takes to click the photo and actually taking it is too long and it's that slow every time kind of discouraging for when you're trying to capture faster motion but I think we'll see this continued software update it's that make this phone and this camera better it's already gotten an update and soon apparently it's going to get manual controls as well so this camera can get better and speaking of software the oneplus 2 is running its own custom rom of near stock android oxygen OS 2.0 or actually 2.1 and i really like it it's quick it's clean it's pretty close to stock Android as you can see and it's customisable in a bunch of ways that are genuinely pretty useful you can rearrange the icons of the toggles on your quick settings to look exactly how you want them and remove the ones that you don't use you can go into the dual SIM card tray settings and use one SIM card for calls and the other one for data or really whatever you want you can take total control of how the SIM cards are used or you can just use one you can use on screen or off screen buttons I choose off screen and then of course you can choose what the hardware buttons do on a long press or a double tap of any of the buttons so that's how I made the DoubleTap of the middle home button open the camera and I also have a long press of that home button open Google nap but you can map a whole bunch more stuff for shortcuts if you want and you can enable a system-wide dark mode and change the accent color throughout the entire OS which can be pretty nifty there's tons of stuff like this you can customize LED notification colors you can customize app permissions tweak animation speeds etc I mean you can really dig in and get your hands dirty and make this phone work exactly the way you want it to the biggest new feature they've added on the home screens that that looks like the furthest from stock Android is called shelf which I guess everyone has to have a screen to the left of the home screens now so you can go into the settings and enable if you want and it's basically just a page with a list of your recent apps frequent contacts and then some widgets of your choice it's kind of neat you can change the header image to whatever you want and any widget in there you can add of any size I'm not sure how many people will find this useful but this is another one of those things that one plus can add features to with a software update so I guess we can be optimistic about its potential and performance throughout all of oxygen OS was top-notch snappy as some might say this is of course thanks to you the choice of your Snapdragon 810 chip super high-end your four gigabytes of RAM and of course a 1080p display not having to push as many pixels as a 1440p display so I'm a fan this usually tends to be the case with near stock Android phones it handles a ram well it remembers a ton of recent apps and multitasking and moving around between apps and web browsing and your typical use is perfectly fine as you'd expect with higher end stuff like gaming there was of course earlier concern about the Snapdragon 810 not being bad but overheating and this phone this phone never got hot on me once I gamed plenty I put a lot of hours into it even if it is throttling to keep temperatures down I'm not noticing any difference in performance or functionality and that's what really matters here battery life was also pretty good this is combining of course the 3300 milliamp hour battery which filled out the space nicely and the near stock Android experience and the great RAM management and the 1080p display instead of 2k all the stuff combines to give my use an average of about three and a half to four hours or a little over four hours of screen on time per day which the way I use a phone since I know it's different for everyone that number for me I would give B+ which is a huge improvement from like the d+ galaxy s6 I was using earlier but also not quite at the level of the champs like the oneplus one and the Droid turbo it's enough to get me through an entire day comfortably but not much past that also there's no power saving mode so once you get down to like 5 3 2 % of battery you probably just want to turn it off so at the end of the day when judging oneplus 2 as a complete package it satisfies my like 5 pillars of a great smartphone package pretty well great performance great camera great display great battery life and great build quality and it kind of nails all of those now I'm used to using like six seven $800 smartphones as my daily driver so when you turn around and tell me this is a $389 smartphone for this version that's pretty damn impressive and I'm actually really curious to see how the Moto X style will come in and compare to this one at a pretty similar price point all I can say is I've had my sim card in this phone for the past couple weeks like I've said and I haven't wanted to take it out now sure as a full time user you notice a lot of things I don't even really see in other reviews like the vibration motor in this phone is really soft it's like really weak for some reasons so if you leave your phone in vibrate only mode I missed a couple calls that way and some notifications which is weird and stuff like some apps like relay for reddit and Phoenix didn't really work that well on this on until the latest version of oxygen OS 2.0.1 which fix a lot of that stuff and even stuff like the home button not responding a hundred percent of the time probably two percent of the time it takes me an extra pressed for it to register but again a lot of this is nitpicking and can be fixed with continual software updates so the worst thing about this phone is how hard it is to buy one again but I would really recommend it to people who are willing to jump through a hoop or two or twelve to buy one thanks for watching guys and talk to you guys in the next one peace 
30,0f_BTRPUr6k,OnePlus 3T Review: T is the new S!,2016-11-21T19:52:32Z,"{'viewCount': '2449984', 'likeCount': '59290', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '4770'}",[Music] hey what's up guys I'm cabby HD here and this this is the one plus 3t and there's just a couple things you need to know about this phone obviously it looks very familiar to the phone 1 plus released less than six months ago the one plus three one of the best budget phones out there for the record great phone for under 400 bucks highly recommended so the one plus three T is - the one plus three as the iPhone 6s was - the iPhone 6 basically T is the new S it's kind of an iteration Allah the phone that came out back in June it's a spec bump fit into the exact same design you wouldn't know it was new just by looking at it unless you knew exactly what you're looking for so here we go I'll tell you exactly what's new number one is you might have noticed is the slightly new color this is called gunmetal and you can see it versus a one plus three is silver you notice the difference right it's subtle it's slightly darker it's kind of more like a Space Gray type of thing I like it there's also a soft gold as well number two is it has a Snapdragon 820 one inside at the higher 2.35 gigahertz clock speeds so not under clocked like it is in the pixel so this is a slightly newer super high-end chip and when you pair that back with the same six gigabytes of RAM you have yourself a pretty high I mean one of the highest end spec sheets of any smartphone so number three and I think that this is my favorite is they fit a much larger battery in this phone in the exact same dimensions this one + 3 T is rocking a 3400 milliamp hour battery up from the 3000 milliamp hour battery you had before that is legit I've been preaching about you know if you can make a phone battery as big as possible even if the phone's a little bit thicker you should do it so now you're getting a 13% bigger battery with the 3 T in the same metal body that should be nice that should translate to much better battery life and screen on time number 4 is this is also now a 128 gigabyte phone so double the storage you had with one plus three was a 64 gigabyte phone tops so 100 when ta that should alleviate some of the concerns of people who really wanted expandable storage you still don't get that but I keep my entire spotify library downloaded for flights and twenty eight gigs was great for me number five is the cameras so the one plus 3t has the exact same 16 megapixel camera on the back that's no change still pretty damn good but it's now rocking a new 16 megapixel front-facing camera so a big upgrade from the 8 megapixel selfie camera from the oneplus 3 obviously you're only going to care about this if you take a lot of selfies or front-facing video but for what it's worth I did notice a difference in the quality of the photos and the videos from the front-facing camera it did seem to struggle a little bit with focus sometimes possibly since it's also an F 2.0 aperture but when you do now focus with this front-facing camera you can tell the difference and the selfies look really good from the 1 + 3 T nice and wide-angle decent colors decent dynamic range again and better sharpness and even a slightly shallower depth of field when your subject is closed and finally number 6 last but not least is the software so you note out of the box the 3t is running Android marshmallow still but with their upgraded very light oxygen OS and that should be upgraded to Android new get very soon and retaining all these features alongside the 1 plus 3 so the 1 plus 3 isn't becoming obsolete that would just be nuts in half a year they're still giving that a software upgrade as well but obviously the higher spec version this 3t replaces the 3 and has a couple new looks and features in oxygen OS as well so they're going to be selling this 3t for 439 so again still really high-end flagship specs for a relatively low price like the pixel with the same chip with a lower clock speed is what 650 bucks to start the galaxy s7 600 bucks you've looked at all the numbers on paper and in user experience this is a great phone for another pretty low price all the rest of the things I didn't talk about in this video are still exactly the same from the oneplus 3 review I'll link it below if you want to watch it again but it's the same great 1080p display same great size and metal build and form factor decent speakers it's still the fastest charging phone in the world I'm pretty sure right now so - charging is awesome to have so all those things plus the upgrades and about a $40 price hike for six months later that's pretty good in my opinion I'm liking this it kind of seems like oneplus is picking up sort of where Nexus left off before pixel showed up where people were really excited for a really mid-range to high-end phone that had really lightweight or pier stock Android for a really low price and the experience would be awesome well now pixels like 650 bucks so if you still want a lightweight Android experience for around half that price 400 bucks ish then seems like one plus three T is the way to go you know how I said the one plus three T is to the three as the 6s is to the six well turns out oneplus did this on purpose they did it for the exact reason the letter T comes one after s so like one better than s kind of one upping Apple in that way whatever maybe they're trolling but well played one plus three T gets my thumbs up in my nod of approval and it will probably be right up at the top like the highest end budget smartphones you can get the smartphone Awards 2016 is coming up if you haven't already noticed so that's something that we're thinking a lot about either way that's been it people said that one plus three owners should be mad because the phone is obsolete six months later no it's not that's still also one of the best budget smartphones of the whole year but that's pretty much all I have to say about the three T let me know what you guys think in the comments section below thank you for watching and talk to you guys the next one peace [Music] 
31,2w5B1Ne-fy4,OnePlus 5 Review!,2017-06-20T20:58:42Z,"{'viewCount': '6355547', 'likeCount': '106875', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '11318'}",[Music] so [Music] hey what is up guys mkbhd here and this is the oneplus 5. and and just like every smartphone in the past three years there's been leaks there's been rumors there's been renders there's been speculation but now it's real it's here in the flesh and this is everything you need to know so oneplus history is actually pretty limited and they're a young small company and because they're a small company they actually don't have the access to all this super high-end tech that the apples and samsungs and motorolas and htc's of the world do that's a disadvantage but the advantage to being a small company is you can actually listen to what your core fan base and what your core customers actually want and try to give them that exact product so oneplus 5 is another incremental improvement over oneplus 3t with a few big bullet point changes and a couple minor touch-ups so first thing you'll notice is the insane specs you can tell it's an enthusiast brand here snapdragon 835 adreno 540 six or eight gigabytes of ram and 64 or 128 gigabytes of storage a dual camera system on the back 16 and 20 megapixel cameras bluetooth 5.0 a 3 300 milliamp hour battery and a 5.5 inch 1080p amoled display and of course an updated unibody metal design okay so not bad let's break it all down the all new design is what's turning heads this time you saw the renders and then you saw all the replies you probably saw all the youtube comments oh from the back it looks like an iphone they're copying apple they've become a copycat company honestly i only agree with some of this i mean obviously the renders when we saw them from that one angle it obviously looks like an iphone because it's got the dual camera system up in the top left corner okay i get that but honestly if you look at the whole entire body of the phone it does resemble some other phones even more so than this one seriously how are these not the same phone plus they've kept a lot of the design cues from previous oneplus phones from the 3 and the 3t with you know the alert slider of course and the ports on the bottom and usb type c it's kind of like a frankenstein smartphone design pulling parts from a bunch of different places but then again how much do you actually look at the back of your phone i mean honestly it actually has to feel good more than it has to look good and this one does it's seven and a half millimeters thin it's got all these rounded sides it's all metal but you don't have to look at it as much as you have to feel it and the oneplus 5 is a good feeling phone they kept that alert slider which i like and always got used to pretty quickly and of course they kept the fingerprint reader up at the front the same like last year and the year before same size same position also the design is kind of limited because the only colors you can actually get this phone in are literally black and almost black which i love matte black that's great but obviously if you want some variety you can grab a skin i'll link to these below it's a dbrand skin and that's easily my favorite way to add color to it without adding the bulk of a case i highly recommend them so this does mean you're not getting the big bezel-less displays that a lot of phones have been moving to this year and that we expected of the new iphone and the new pixel etc we still have some pretty thin side bezels here but it's definitely not quite the same effect i actually found it interesting that in the verge's exclusive video of like the making of this phone that they dropped yesterday they actually admitted like they would have liked to have done something like an infinity display or a bezel-less screen but they just don't have the tech to do it that's another disadvantage of being a small company now the dual camera system on the back before we even get to photo quality is already pretty interesting first of all it's it's the headlining new feature it's on the box right twice so it's clearly what they want you to focus on no pun intended but it is a 16 megapixel f 1.7 primary camera with electronic image stabilization and then a 20 megapixel f 2.6 telephoto camera as a secondary on paper that looks pretty good and then when you open up the new camera app you'll notice it is a blatant copy of the iphone camera app no doubt about that the 1x to 2x button for switching between the lenses is there settings in the strip on the left shutter button on the right it's pretty basic and then the slider of course between the 1x and the 2x when zooming in it's definitely a copy here no one can really deny that here's the thing i've always said i don't really mind if you copy stuff but if you're going to copy something copy the good stuff so if you're going to copy the iphone one of the best and most popular phones out there then yeah sure copy the camera copy the fingerprint reader don't copy the bad stuff don't copy like siri or something bixby so this one extra 2x button and the slider and everything in the camera it's kind of the best way to do it so i don't mind that being a copy at all so how are the photos well they're pretty good there's no doubt that the sensor is capable of some pretty great clean photos again i wish it had optical image stabilization but essentially this camera is a hit or miss experience i've been taking photos with this camera for more than a week now and in just like everyday scenarios and a lot of them turn out really nice some of them though you'll notice turn out a little weird dynamic range is pretty much always great snapdragon 835 can handle taking multiple exposures at the same time so you'd expect it to be great and detail is pretty much always on point the center of the frame and whatever's in focus is always sharp colors and image processing were pretty average i feel like nothing was pushed too far in contrast or saturation except maybe the reds a little bit because sometimes they got oversaturated but otherwise it's pretty subjective whether you like the look of a photo or not i think objectively it'll score high on camera benchmark tests because it's very fast very sharp and has huge dynamic range but side by side with the same shot from pixel or an iphone it could be a toss-up which is quite good for a phone at this price and then there's the portrait mode from the secondary telephoto camera honestly overall this wasn't any better than the same attempts from the iphone 7 plus but also not worse kind of struggles with complex edges but for the most part it does a good job blurring backgrounds obviously it does a much better job on humans than it does on less predictable less portraity subjects and it still has some weird halo effects near the edges but just overall it doesn't quite match having a naturally shallow depth of field obviously so if you're into it you can use it i think it'll get better with time with software updates like apples has you know apples was awful when it first came out and was in beta but it's learned and it's gotten better over time with portraits and i think this one will too but right now it's right in line with what we've already seen so nothing super new here also you might be wondering why the secondary telephoto sensor with the worst aperture gets the 20 megapixel sensor while the primary gets the 16 megapixel but their logic for that is pretty simple it's that when you're doing all that zooming and you go way zoomed in you're using all the data from the telephoto sensor so you want it to be a higher resolution so makes sense so beyond the design and the camera and the specs a couple more minor things are new and a lot of the rest is the same stuff we've seen from previous oneplus phones it's great stuff but it's the same stuff so battery here is 3 300 milliamp hours so not bigger it's actually 100 milliamp hours smaller than the 3t but the battery life is about the same it lasts comfortably all day thanks to the chip and the display and that display that 1080p amoled display this is probably the thing that's going to get looked at as the biggest downside of a phone when you compare it to the more expensive flagships but those are all the phones that enthusiasts are also considering buying so you kind of have to note those all have 1440p displays or higher so it's really easy to say oh this is 1080p it must be awful but i'd always challenge those people to really look at the display and tell if it really does look that much worse i mean when i first got it first took it out the box when it was brand new didn't even look at the spec sheet and tried to just look at it and tell if i could see if it's a 1080p display or did they finally move to 1440p and it took me more than just a glance so it's a pretty good display it gets bright enough has pitch black blacks from being an amoled etc it's good and then of course that 1080p display also means performance is a plus a snapdragon 835 with the adreno 540 and 8 gigs of ram of course all pushing near stock android on a 1080p display it better not hiccup this thing flies through android and that's its biggest asset i think super smooth performance tons of apps stay in memory for a long time haven't had any memory leak issues and that's credit to oneplus keeping the same software philosophy again near stock android with a couple of improvements no skin really no big overlay just a couple tweaks thrown in here and there in the settings that they believe will improve the experience so you can do things like switch between the off-screen or on-screen buttons again with oneplus 5 you can still mess with the shelf to the left of the home screen by adding widgets to it or messing with the built-in widgets that oneplus includes or you can disable it completely your call there's also now a gaming do not disturb mode which halts all banner notifications from popping up when certain apps like games are open the camera app now has a pro mode which lets you go full on with manual mode for everything you know aperture focus distance white balance iso etc and it shoots raw and it even has the level and a live histogram for exposure the extended screenshot mode is pretty cool you start the extended screenshot mode and it literally starts scrolling infinitely until you tell it to stop and then that's where the screenshot ends it's pretty intuitive and it's just kind of fun to watch it's well done dash charging is still awesome so if you're a super heavy user and you get through this whole thing in a day it recharges as fast as any other smartphone out there bluetooth 5.0 is on board nfc is not skipped this time the vibration motor is a lot stronger and louder and more noticeable so if you're into that that's important and the microphones are also improved now too so for recording video and super loud environments these will do better so is the oneplus 5 worth your money well if you can get over the design if you're not one of those people who just wants to say it looks like an iphone if you can get over that then yeah this is definitely a great phone there's not a whole lot that you can get with a snapdragon 835 and eight gigs of ram and near stock android so if you can get over the design and not having an infinity display i think this is going to be a great phone for the money and i'll give it a thumbs up don't get one if you can i think you'll enjoy it that's pretty much it thank you for watching i'll talk to you guys the next one peace [Music]

guys mkbhp here and well welcome back to techtober the event that we are waiting for just wrapped up which means i'm not allowed to share that my daily driver for the past couple days has been the brand new oneplus 6t so this phone's had a lot of hype leading up to it we started seeing those specs and a little bit of design leaks and basically got a lot of people waiting for this phone so the oneplus 6t is in the purest sense of the word an incremental update most of it is the same as the oneplus 6 that we're already familiar with that i liked a lot and then you could consider this a bit of a design refresh a couple months later so they took the oneplus 6 which is already a pretty solid and well-liked phone and they made some upgrades and some tweaks to things that they felt could be better and they took it up a notch okay there's your notch pun for the video so there are conveniently six new things with the oneplus 6t so first of all the new display it's bigger it's a 6.4 inch display and still your 2340x1080 optic amoled they've been on for a while and it's still pretty great it's bright it's colorful and has a built-in adjustable color profiles obviously i'm a big phone person and phone screens keep getting bigger and i still love it also slightly smaller chin than the oneplus 6 not drastically smaller but you can see it when you put them side by side so the display is definitely an improvement and that brings us to number two as you can see the teardrop notch up here at the top everything oneplus wanted to do with the fairly standard notch on the oneplus 6 they are still doing in the smaller notch on this 6t except for the notification led so up here is the front-facing camera the earpiece and the proximity and ambient light sensors no fancy face id dot projector or depth sensors or anything like that but just a pretty solid basic couple things they can still do their super fast facial recognition with the rgb camera that has its pros and cons and the speaker is slotted way up here at the top but it wasn't doing a whole lot anyway so we're not missing out much by shoving a tiny speaker up there and for a lot of people including me this is an improvement larger screen closer to the bezels and more room up top for notifications and info but you can still hide the notch with software if you want to the only weird feeling i got about it is like how curvy it is just i mean that's quite the curve from left to right if you remember the essential phone that notch had probably about the same volume and total size but it was pretty rectangular on the sides this one is all slopey and then it just it just touches the top of whatever app you're using in the middle it's interesting but you get used to it just like any other notch okay number three is the fingerprint reader underneath the display something again a lot of people were looking forward to happy to see this slowly starting to become more common in mainstream phones so that one plus six couple months ago had the fingerprint reader on the back that's now gone and it's moved the logo up a little bit in its place and you can now unlock your phone by just touching the glass i've left it enabled the entire time i've been using it and i'd say it's it's faster than that first gen from the vivo phone i first tested a couple months ago but uh still slower than the gold standard of like touch id or a lot of the physical fingerprint readers it's just somewhere in between it's not instant but it's just a little beat of you unlocking your phone it's it's getting there you can't really just touch your finger to the screen and then remove it quickly and get to using the phone it'll still tell you you're going too fast but if you leave it there for a beat you're in pretty quick the animation is pretty corny i think and there's two others you can pick from in the software but the thing is they all happen at full brightness that's part of how the tech of this optical fingerprint reader underneath the screen works it involves shining a light on your fingerprint so even though it's an oled and they can keep all the pixels black and the clock is dim to save battery the fingerprint reader when it reads your finger goes to max brightness and at night that can be kind of annoying basically i was hoping there could be an even more subtle animation than the three that were provided also that means that unlocking the phone at night or when it's dark specifically is kind of annoying i know it's definitely nitpicking at this point but think about it i have both face unlock and fingerprint unlock enabled at night when it's dark the face unlock camera which just uses the rgb camera doesn't work very well so you have to use the fingerprint and then when you use the fingerprint it shines that full brightness light that kind of bleeds around your finger into your face which is kind of annoying just i know that's again super minor but this is the kind of stuff you notice when you use a phone every day so i'll mention it number four is the new battery so while the phone is pretty much the same size this is oneplus biggest improvement on paper going from a 3300 to a 3700 milliamp hour battery that has been awesome in practice for the endurance of this phone the six was already pretty good but i'm now getting pretty consistently five plus hours of screen on time one of the days i had nearly six hours with 10 left so it might not be a 4 000 milliamp hour sell like it isn't the biggest number on paper but this improvement thanks to the 1080p oled and pretty clean software has this basically my battery champ this year so far and it still has that incredibly fast fast charging so that is impressive then number five uh it's true the headphone jack is now gone on the 6t even oneplus is getting rid of the headphone jack a moment of silence for its loss so yeah it's 2018 pretty much only samsung and lg are left still riding that headphone jack train and it's kind of interesting coming from a company like oneplus who we know to usually be first to listen to what users want so when i asked them what their reasoning was for not having a headphone jack because i got to ask them directly they said it's the larger battery and the fingerprint reader under the screen both take up so much extra space in this same size phone that they felt it made sense to get rid of the headphone jack so that's their words and the number six new different thing is probably the best news this phone starts at 128 gigs of storage now instead of 64 and for the same exact price as the last one 549 so you get twice as much storage for the same starting price and this whole new design so oneplus is sure sticking to their guns of competitive pricing and then that's it everything else about the oneplus 6t in the software on the surface under the hood materials and build it's all the same as that one plus six same oxygen os on top of android pie with the new gestures and all the new features oneplus has been throwing in same smoothness and a plus performance that i was so happy about a couple months ago that drew me away from the pixel same snapdragon 845 and six or eight gigs of ram so i expect it to continue to be smooth same colors so it's launching with this midnight black or mirror black which means you may still want to toss on a skin from our sponsor dbrand this matrix black they have happens to look pretty damn good and now you won't see nearly as many fingerprints so kind of a win-win there and oneplus still took the shortcuts they took last year so no wireless charging for example even though it's a glass back phone and it's the same exact camera the hardware sensor and lens and everything as the oneplus 6. so you can see photos from last year's phone they are going to start to look better with each round of software updates they're learning a lot from pixel and iphone's hdr techniques and building them in here plus a new night mode is here that does more with longer exposures and dark scenes but of course all these changes are also coming to the exact same oneplus 6 camera since it's just a software change and they kept of course one of the most important things about the six which was a starting price easy recommendation this is a great phone now it's also coming with verizon compatibility and they're gonna start working with t-mobile you'll see it in t-mobile stores i'm assuming so this is going to be making its first big push into carriers in the us which is pretty cool uh yeah there's a lot going for this phone it's continued to impress me even though they got rid of the headphone jack which is a bummer for a lot of people but it's been impressive how much they stick with the fast and smooth mantra through their phones these have been consistently the fastest phones i use for the past couple years which is great and that's a function of how much they care about software so i have no problem recommending oneplus 6t this is just the oneplus 6 in a prettier higher tech package with a bigger battery for the same price can't really go wrong there so that's been it what do you think is this your next phone let me know thanks for watching talk to you guys the next one peace 
33,XRiUNPf-_-4,"OnePlus 7T Review: High Refresh, Low Price!",2019-09-26T15:01:13Z,"{'viewCount': '3638466', 'likeCount': '93443', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '6875'}",[Music] hey what's up guys mkbhd here and this is the oneplus 7t so if you follow the leaks aka promo you've probably seen pretty much every angle of this thing but now it's officially been unveiled i've been using it daily for about a week and this is a pretty easy phone to explain so oneplus the company they have their sort of upper mid-range phones somewhere around 500 600 like oneplus 7 then they have their premium high-end flagship stuff like oneplus 7 pro that's closer to seven eight hundred bucks so this phone the oneplus 7t kind of kind of a hard name to say out loud it's not the 70 but it's the oneplus 7t this phone is sort of a frankenstein between those two groups it's right between the super high end and the upper mid range if that makes any sense so to be perfectly clear it is a really great phone for the price which is basically the one plus special at this point they've continued this fascinating slow creep up in price but when you go over this phone and everything they've combined in here it's pretty on point for what you're getting for 599 bucks so this display is a perfect example right so just look at this screen the whole phone is really big as you can tell but that's because it's got this huge 6.55 inch oled screen it's just barely smaller than the 7 pro actually and that's a huge phone but you have the teardrop notch at the top from the 7 and it's a flat screen now instead of one of those panels that curves around the edges and i'm down with that and it is 90 hertz so this is as far as i know i guess the cheapest phone with a high refresh rate display like this and i'm glad they brought that down that's becoming a signature characteristic of these phones so overall it's a nice combination of things despite not being the highest end display you know it gets pretty bright up to a thousand nits so outdoor visibility is no problem and the teardrop notch being a little smaller makes it super easy to ignore on this gigantic screen but it's also 1080p not 1440 and the bezels are just a little bit thicker a tiny bit as you can see and i have noticed some real off-axis color tint and rainbowing and other consistencies like that that you'll notice on not so high-end oled displays so it's not the super best of the best but it's like right underneath it's right in between it's making sense right they're bringing things down from the higher end phone that makes sense while keeping the sort of baseline of the mid-range the higher fresh rate i think is the most important thing that they brought down that i just i love me some 90 hertz some high refresh rate goodness so that's good to see and then just the design of this phone in general is also a bit of a frankenstein you've probably noticed it by now there's this aura blue color again although this time it's not as matte as before it's kind of closer to like a satin because it has more of a sheen to it it's not really glossy like some other phones but you definitely do still see fingerprints much more than a matte phone so it's somewhere in between again the 7 pro is more matte than this one but here's some other improvements you do have the alert slider is tighter so it's more satisfying to move between the three positions so that's pretty sweet they brought down the high-end really precise haptic motor that's honestly only really matched on android by the pixel at this point so that was great and they brought the optical fingerprint reader underneath the glass that's also the same sensor as the one from the seven pro and i think one of the best in any phone under the glass right now the speakers are also just as good as the 7 pro they sound loud and full and there's also a bigger speaker grow up at the top and charging is now even faster so they're calling it warp charge 30t it's still a 30 watt fast charger but thanks to improved battery chemistry in the 3 800 milliamp hour battery in this phone it'll charge 23 faster than warp charge 30 already did so in other words it's silly fast and it's kind of a you know a different philosophy on battery management on one hand i love you know the little chunkier phones that'll have this massive battery inside an all-day battery life it changes the way i use phones i didn't worry about charging ever during the day but on the other hand a phone that's really trim like this that has crazy fast charging just lets you have this peace of mind that anytime you're starting to get low you can just plug in for a couple minutes and be right back up to 70 80 percent so that's like a different kind of confidence in the battery i don't really have a preference between the two it would be great to have both but uh as of right now i like having this warp charge 30t they say will get you to 70 from dead in half an hour and that's awesome and i believe that but i'm even more impressed by just how much you can add from plugging in for five minutes 10 minutes and just giving you a massive boost for the rest of the day so the 7t does have decent battery life but this is the steady compromise they make for not having the best battery life and then of course the gigantic camera circle on the back uh it's genuinely i think the first design from oneplus that doesn't feel to me like really sleek or clean like they've done triple cameras before even but this one is very different it kind of reminds me of somewhere between motorola or the red hydrogen or you might even remember the nokia lumia series back in the day funny thing is these are essentially the same exact cameras that the oneplus 7 pro already has same standard 48 megapixel standard camera same 117 degree ultra wide and then a shorter 2x telephoto zoom camera instead of a 3x so if you're actually looking for some big camera improvements for the 7t that is not what's happening here uh and it's actually not like the oneplus 7 pro camera was bad it's just that it was the one part of the phone that wasn't you know best in class world class it sort of held it back from being an arguably perfect phone in a way but in a 600 phone in 2019 this set of cameras is perfectly good i've been taking photos and videos with it just to see if i notice any substantial differences around but uh there isn't anything too drastic still very solid in daylight and a bit color fringy and soft around the edges with close-up subjects and passable but not amazing shots in less than ideal lighting if you think about other cameras in this 600 price range that's about right actually uh right up until they start to get blown out the water by the seven hundred dollar iphone 11. you can take portrait mode shots now in telephoto or standard cameras now which is cool and they are also enabling 4k 30fps video from the ultrawide camera so they've heard our feedback they are going to do that and i think the most impressive improvement here is the new super macro mode so you hit this little flower icon in the top corner and you can get way up close to things uh 2.5 to 8 centimeters away from the camera lens which most smartphones do struggle with if they don't have a macro mode and so with this i was able to take some close-ups that i couldn't even get with the iphone 11 and then of course this wouldn't be a new oneplus phone without really killer high-end on-paper specs and so that's what they've done here again so snapdragon e55 plus the newest chip eight gigs of ram not 12 and 128 or 256 gigs of ufs 3.0 storage so yeah this thing is fast and it's running the latest version of oxygen os 10 on top of android 10 which i think makes this the first non-pixel android 10 phone i've used and it's been really good so far i obviously love that they're early to updates and performance has actually been really smooth you may have noticed i didn't keep the android 10 gestures the swipe gestures turned on here's why android 10 gestures on this phone are a swipe up from the bottom for home a half swipe up for multitasking and then a swipe in from the lower side to go back from anywhere you know what else uses that swipe to go back on the side a lot of android apps for other things twitter to switch between accounts flamingo for twitter ticktick my tasks app youtube studio google photos the play store i mean a lot of google apps use that hamburger menu and the screen is so big on this phone that i don't really want to reach up to the corner with one hand to press the hamburger menu every single time so i don't so i turned it off and i just keep using the buttons for now but aside from that android 10 has been really nice really smooth as you'd expect on a new phone with a 90 hertz screen and all the optimizations oneplus is continually working on for oxygen os they really show so all that for me using this phone has added up to it being a pretty solid set of trade-offs that add up to a pretty good phone for pretty great price it really feels like they're taking the stuff that they learned how to do better and more efficiently from the 7 pro and bringing it down to a more competitive price which is a great way to sell a lot of phones now of course to be perfectly clear the oneplus 7 pro is still a better phone than this just because of the small bit of trade-offs they've kept a higher quality display higher resolution not as much color fringing and things like that uh bigger battery uh less ugly camera bump on the back and the notchless screen on the front so all that sort of adds up to a little bit of trade-offs here but overall this is that incremental update you expect from a t-phone from oneplus with the x factor of that 90hz display that is so hard to switch back from so that's the statement that the phone leaves me with is that i'm glad that oneplus is doubling down on the high refresh rate stuff to really make phones feel smooth high refresh rate all the things please this is going to be a really good buy for people who want to spend like 600 bucks on a phone but for me i'm personally going to be pretty excited about the oneplus 7t pro names are getting weird but that's the phone that's going to have the best of the best that i'm looking forward to but yeah not bad i'll have a link below if you want to check it out that's been it thank you for watching and i'll catch you guys the next one peace you 
34,7IaYSxDp88s,OnePlus 10 Pro Impressions: What Happened?,2022-01-28T03:09:41Z,"{'viewCount': '4179712', 'likeCount': '118319', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '8984'}",[Music] hey what's up i'm kbhd here and you might not know this but the oneplus 10 pros out kinda oneplus has been on a kind of a weird trajectory lately and i've kind of already talked about it but this is the latest weirdest step so i say it's kinda out because well you're watching this video on youtube which is not in china but this phone is officially landed and launched only in china so it's not out where you're watching this but we'll likely see an international launch at some point this year for this phone so i was able to get my hands on this one thanks to our friends at dbrand but if you wanted to get one you have to import it from a site like 28 mobile or something like that but even so the software that this phone is running is not the oxygen os that oneplus fans have come to know and love in many regions so basically this phone might have a oneplus box and the oneplus logo and a oneplus red cable but this oneplus 10 pro is more like an oppo phone than ever before now you might have seen all the specs and teasers and stuff about this phone as they were coming up to their launch and i'll get to all that in a second but the biggest thing to note really is that this phone this one right here is literally running oppo software so it has color os the same color os that an oppo phone would have this is color os 12.1 so the oxygen os that's been so important to oneplus for years that i've really liked in the past is not here so we've got some oppo built stock apps and it's got a bunch of incomplete menus that don't have english translations there's a bunch of pre-installed chinese apps that can't be disabled this is clearly not meant to be exported to other regions the default browser's pretty rough i mean it's it's mostly fine and it does have a lot of customization features i think the wallpaper color picker is super cool and i've gotten google apps to work other than the assistant so i can make my way around but it's not ideal so sort of overhanging all of this is okay will this phone have oxygen os or not when it eventually probably launches internationally i don't know it's unconfirmed we don't have an answer yet and even though it's not perfect and honestly oxygen os is more like color os than ever before in its latest version i still am kind of hoping for it because it's more complete anyway the one thing that will be the same no matter where you get this phone in any region is this new design this slightly controversial new design it's kind of a mixed bag for me i like parts of it i don't like some other parts of it so there's always a difference between seeing it in the renders and the teasers versus actually holding it and filling it in person and i gotta say in person it's a pretty solid design it's a nice size roughly the same size as last year's oneplus 9 pro big but not too big it's got the same smooth satin black finish in this volcanic black color and the other version is this sort of emerald green type of satin finish and it's still got all the classic oneplus shapes and cues the centered logo on the middle of the back the speaker and sim card tray at the bottom the alert slider which has just moved up a little bit higher on the phone really the biggest change with this new design is the camera layout so clearly there's a bit of inspiration from what samsung did with the s21 series a little bit of a copy my homework but don't make it too obvious going on here but i do still like samsung's version more because it still feels more intentional one because it goes all the way up to the corner and it feels like a more integrated part of the design and two because of this seam here so oneplus has this awesome satin black and the whole back and all the rails around the phone are satin but then it cuts at this seam to do a glossy camera array and i know we've done the stovetop joke about other phones before but i mean this one this one looks more like a stovetop than any i've ever seen it's actually only three cameras though the fourth in the corner is a bi-color led flash with some text in the middle that says p2d50t now if you're wondering what p2d50t actually stands for i asked oneplus because i mean there's not a whole lot of other text on the phone why did they put this here apparently p stands for phone 2d stands for second generation hasselblad mobile camera system 50t stands for 50 megapixel triple camera setup so so p2d 50t just printed okay i don't see a specific ip rating anywhere for this phone but it does have the rubber seals around things like the sim card tray which the ip68 certified oneplus 9 pro also had so i'm thinking it'll also survive normal splashes and stuff but the only other update on the outside is a small one it's the new display same size at 6.7 inches with the top left corner selfie camera cut out and an optical fingerprint sensor that's nicely higher up on the phone i was wondering why last year's is so low and i never really got an answer but this one isn't a nicer spot for sure anyway it's the same resolution 1440p same max frame rate 120 hertz but this is an ltpo2 panel meaning it can modulate all the way down to 1 hertz instead of 10 hertz so it can save even more power than earlier ldpo displays definitely looking forward to seeing pretty much every high-end phone make this same upgrade this year then inside this phone does have pretty much all the high-end specs that you'd expect from a oneplus flagship phone now this isn't the full review i'm not daily driving this phone because half the software is in chinese and it's kind of hard for me to do that but this does give us a pretty good idea of how it'll perform and i mean with high-end specs there aren't really any surprises here it's got the snapdragon 8 gen 1 chipset new naming scheme for the new generation of four nanometer chips first phone i've tested with it uh it's it's very similar in performance to the snapdragon triple eight with a bump in the gpu department and most significantly better ai and ml performance so you can imagine as the highest end non-custom silicon chip you can get in a phone combined with the high refresh rate display ufs 3.1 storage lpddr5 ram it's going to perform very well there's even a ram extender feature that you can use so you can sort of carve out some of that fast storage to act like extra ram if you want to basically i have thought for a few years actually that oppo's color os has some of the better animations of any android skin and that's still true so things are very smooth and responsive here across the board and then the bonus is some slightly better gaming performance and a new image signal processor which should improve the cameras which speaking of the cameras how are they right this is uh this is a new i mean the design very much highlights these new cameras and the hasselblad logo is right there so does it deliver well basically the camera housing might have gotten a redesign but the actual camera system is almost the same as last year so it's the same 48 megapixel main camera the same 8 megapixel 3.3 x telephoto camera as last year and a new 150 degree ultra wide so the new second generation hasselblad mobile camera system is as far as we can tell the same mobile camera system plus a new ultrawide unclear if there's any new lenses or anything going into the hardware but that's what we get okay got it so my initial impressions shooting with it are the actual quality of the images is still pretty good i mean we know what this main camera is capable of which is some pretty nice shots and daytime lighting plus the larger sensor giving real shallow depth of field plus a little fringing with some close-up subjects but that's not a surprise here but whatever's in focus in the middle of the frame or near the middle of the frame gets pretty good detail and sharpness and it looks fine i was looking for some new like color science maybe maybe the second generation hasselblad stuff has more to do with image processing and colors in dynamic range i think are still good not too over processed but nothing dramatically better than expected here the colors from the ultra wide are definitely a bit different from the primary camera and it's definitely not as sharp but that can improve a bit with software updates i just found the shutter speed not very fast so you got to really hold still and take photos of still subjects but hey not all subjects stay still so in my initial testing like object photos and still scenes are no problem but people and pets get a little more blurred sometimes especially in lower light the selfie camera though is actually new 32 megapixels not super wide and not really noteworthy in the quality department in my opinion but hey y'all want to know about the selfie camera so there you go this hasselblad partnership is more than just image quality though it's also about features and so the new ultrawide is a new feature and you know if you just open the camera and just switch to the ultrawide it'll look exactly the same as any other but buried in the settings there is a 150 degree ultra wide mode that lets you get really really wide and take advantage of that new sensor and lenses it does a pretty good job not distorting things too much considering how wide it is which is very impressive at this angle so even if the photos aren't super sharp they're still unique and pretty impressive and then you can hit this button and get in that full on all the way fisheye circle image mode to capture everything no video capture in this mode i think that would have been cool like sort of reminiscent of old skate videos but yeah this is pretty sweet there's also the hasselblad x-pan mode to shoot in that 65 by 24 aspect ratio reminiscent of a classic hasselblad camera and there's a new pro mode with some raw formats which is great and a new long exposure mode cool but overall as you can tell you know not a huge difference in the camera department basically if you weren't sold on last year's phone then this one's not going to change your mind but i think i can wrap this up with one thing that did improve dramatically and that is the battery so without getting much thicker or bigger this phone is now packing a 5 000 milliamp hour battery and upgrades to 80 watt wired charging plus 50 watt wireless charging which is sick so usually you get you know a huge battery but not so fast charging or a medium-sized battery but with ultra fast charging it's sort of like pick and choose this is really impressive this is basically combining the best of both worlds so from a low battery you can add about 60 charge in 15 minutes which on such a big battery can last you an entire new day and even if you don't have a heavy day of use you know i haven't really used this phone for very long but you can already tell this bigger battery combined with the ltpo2 display is going to reward lighter usage days with a much longer screen on time i feel like there's something different about this charger though i mean this is the old one this it's a little more squared off it's still got the red cable it's still the same size oh right uh it's an oppo charger so as part of the the melting of the oppo and oneplus brands the oppo vacation of oneplus as we've talked about yeah they switched literally to a supervooc charger it says it on their site that's the name of oppo's fast charging tech uh it's no longer a warp charger that oneplus used to ship with everything now honestly the name of the charging tech doesn't really bother me that much but the most annoying part is it's switched back to usb-a this is a usb-a charger now all of these warp chargers were usb-c and so now we've gone back so i can't use usb-c to usb-c cables anymore i have to use this cable so this is annoyingly backwards i mean the fact that the phone does come with the charger in the box is sadly like bonus points for this phone that's what you have to do when 80 watt charging is one of your features is nobody has an 80 watt charger so you have to throw it in but yeah here you go it's a usba charger also if you want to do that 50 watt air vook wireless charging that is a separate extra oppo wireless charger still a super impressive battery though and you know what else is super impressive channel sponsor cash app so cash app is impressive not just because it's the best way to send spend and save money but also it comes with a debit card that you can fully customize and then cash app will laser print and mail it to you whatever your fancy design and the card comes with free discounts to places you love called boosts so you're definitely going to want to check out cash app if you haven't already the link is below you can use code marquez for 15 and 10 dollars will go to girls who code appreciate your cash app so almost exactly one year ago today it was january last year i did a what happened to oneplus video and i was basically talking i'll link it below it's just talking about how they went from a very enthusiast focused company to a very normal company making normal phones it didn't really stand out in quite the same way and this is their most normal phone yet now that doesn't mean it's a bad phone at all it's actually quite good and you know lots of the stuff that i've always liked about oneplus phones are still here it's got the fast and smooth stuff it's got the high refresh rate display great performance and high-end specs really really fast charging on a massive new battery and of course decent cameras still got the alert slider great haptics so it's got a lot of good stuff but we don't have an international launch so therefore we don't have a real price for this phone yet so i gotta withhold any of my official review type judgment until then like if it ends up being seven eight nine hundred dollars which is probably about where it'll land i could see it being pretty reasonable but anything higher than that it's competing with the big dogs and i think anything lower than that would be a surprise so let me know would you want a phone like this the oneplus 10 pro thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace 
35,3yEP4ooj1WI,OnePlus 11 Review: They're Back?!,2023-02-07T15:15:15Z,"{'viewCount': '3803209', 'likeCount': '121758', 'favoriteCount': '0', 'commentCount': '7353'}",I was kind of wondering how long it would be before I could say this again if I'd ever say it again but OnePlus is kind of back so this is the new OnePlus 11. now people who have been following the industry for a little bit already know the story behind this phone which is OnePlus starting out hot as a fan favorite with a plus bang for the buck Flagship killer type of phones peaking I'd say around the OnePlus 7 Pro it's my phone of the year and then slowly descending into the very generic expensive Flagship that they swore to kill their last attempt at a phone the 10t is literally the worst phone that came out last year it won my bust of the year and I got a trophy for it and apparently they've used this as motivation they keep saying oh they now they want to redeem themselves now they're gonna turn it around and you know great like I think we all know the next phone was already in the works by the time they got that trophy but if you want to give me some credit I'll take some credit sure but the point is they're sort of reflecting shades of old OnePlus which is a really good thing because this phone is really good so this is a flagship smartphone right now for 6.99 in a world where the Galaxy s23 just came out it's 7.99 that's a sort of a de facto default for a lot of people my semi-hot take is this could be a better phone for a lot of people now it's not perfect and they still do some classic Corner cutting things to pull this off and there are still some software behaviors that I really do not like but here are the basics so if you want just a classic spec sheet bang for the buck summary this phone has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 with 8 gigs of RAM a 6.7 inch 1440p 120 hertz OLED display triple cameras and a 5 000 milliamp hour battery with 80 watt charging for 699 bucks that's pretty damn good so I think because the phone has like the nice screen the big battery and the newest chip it begs comparisons to like the 900 000 other Flagship phones but like I said it does cut some Corners the big one being no wireless charging huge and then the other it's ip64 rated instead of IP67 so it'll survive a Mist better than a splash but on the design front I'd call this a mixed bag mixed bag you know it definitely is taking a step away from the ultra generic last generation the Hasselblad branding is back and we'll talk about the cameras in a minute but also the alert slider is back literally an iconic OnePlus feature that they somehow thought getting rid of last time was a good idea this one also has a very slightly textured matte black finish on the back not quite Sandstone level but enough to be interesting so I like it and the camera bump the camera bump is kind of a weird hybrid of smoothly wrapping around the side like Samsung used to but then turning it into a big circle Plateau that looks like a generic not seamless thing anymore at all it's whatever I don't mind it it's fine but you're not here for the back of the phone though like honestly if you just saw the back and saw the lack of wireless charging and a slightly awkward camera bump it feels like a 699 phone sure but the front is where it gets way more impressive 6.7 inch corner to corner thin bezel with a slight curve over the edges I wish it was flatter but it's not too bad 1440p resolution 120 hertz ltpo OLED 1000 Hertz touch sample rate and 1300 nits Peak brightness that's visible outdoors in all but direct sunlight and that little corner cut out for the selfie camera that's nearly as good as you can ask for these days and actually using a phone it's very Snappy and smooth it's got the fingerprint reader on the display in just the right spot it's fast and OnePlus One a little over the top with like the future proofing of the highest end fastest internals it's good details like this phone has not just Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6E but the brand new Wi-Fi 7 not just UF S3 but ufs 4.0 the fastest storage and not just LP ddr5 but LP ddr5x the fastest memory available so this is legitimately very Snappy and it's a quick phone brand new but then because of those high-end internals I do expect the Headroom to age pretty well the snap Dragon Age Gen 2 has proven to be a pretty good chip like the other phones that have had it so far have been really good phones and this is too it's a powerful chip and the GPU is great but also it's been pretty efficient and that's affecting the battery situation and I think for battery on this phone this is where it feels the most like old OnePlus so the OnePlus 11 has a 5 000 milliamp hour battery great battery life so if I if I use it like normal maxed out High brightness 1440p and 120 hertz on I'm making it to the end of the day fine no problem when I go 1080P and still 120 hertz I was able to get two days out of this phone matter of fact I'm on the second day right now it's almost noon I have 31 percent that's pretty good I'm getting to the end of two light days with like seven eight hours of screen on time fine that's really good and then for charging in the US this one has 80 watt charging I think in China other versions have 100 watt charging there's a difference in electrical standards but super fast charging so if I ever found myself thinking oh I need a little extra battery it's kind of low right now it was rare but I could plug in for a few minutes and have more than enough it is that Oppo supervook charging Tech so it's still the brick with USB a instead of USBC but hey at least it comes in the Box plus the cable so I know also having wireless charging would be really convenient and it's kind of annoying going from a phone that does have wireless charging to one that doesn't but I think OnePlus is counting on people who have other phones now that don't have wireless charging moving to this one and finding it's like an awesome battery experience so that's what they're counting on but let me talk about the cameras in this phone because these are also a throwback to Old OnePlus which if you remember those phones means not as good as the flagships but really solid so it's got that 50 megapixel main camera that bins down to 12 and a half megapixels and it gives me images that are generally pretty sharp and nice if you don't zoom in I mean I was pleasantly surprised that in most different types of shooting scenarios it was at least capable of giving me a solid shot even in low light when it does miss it tends to overexpose a bit and even more so with darker skin tones also focus is a little suspiciously slow sometimes so I found myself taking multiple shots of moving objects just to make sure I got a good one but you know what if the bar is being set at just a good enough camera that it's not a dead giveaway that it's a cheaper phone it clears that bar for sure I couldn't tell you how much that Hasselblad partnership is actually doing for photos here I mean color science maybe it seems like there's pretty balanced colors and nice Optical characteristics but like that's about all I can say about that I mean the photos look fine the ultrawide is definitely soft near the edges of the frame but at least it matches colors pretty well with the main and it does do macro when you get super up close to things but it's not good macro I mean it does the macro but yeah not great the only reason I'm not going to keep dailying this phone though aside from other phones that I have to test very soon is the software there's just some things that I I mean the software is fine lots of people use this software all over the world I have no problem with it there's so many little quirks and things that they just add up and they get annoying so here if you're going to be like old OnePlus One Plus let's have some feedback let's listen to some user feedback here so I'm an Android User who spends a lot of time in the notifications it's very important part of the phone a lot of other people spend a lot of time there too in every other Android phone that I've used when you have a notification you can swipe left or swipe right to clear them but for some reason on this phone you can only swipe away to the right if you swipe to the left no matter how fast your swipe is it pulls up settings and then you have to swipe again to clear so this is slightly annoying every single time and then in every other Android phone if I have multiple notifications from the same app then I can swipe down with one or two fingers to view each one and if I just want to open the app you click it or if you want to open a specific instance of that notification you can do that when it's expanded on this phone for some reason you can't swipe to expand the group of notifications you can only click it which expands it but then in the apps where there's a single notification and you want to expand it like a camera preview or a message preview or something with more information you can't just swipe like every other Android phone you have to tap this tiny bar at the top of the notification around that Arrow to view the preview that is even more annoying over time and then in every other Android phone if you pull down your notifications and you have a lot of them you can always go you know what never mind and then pull them all the way back up to close on this phone it takes multiple swipes to get through all your notifications and close them every time that's a little more annoying and then if you have music playing in the background say on Spotify or podcast or something you want to get to that app on every other phone it's a swipe and a Tap Away on this phone it's a swipe a tap and another tap to get to the app there's a bunch of little things like that from coming from almost any other Android phone that doesn't use color Os or this version of software and it would be fine if that's the default Behavior but there's at least a toggle to let me not have that happen every time but it happens every time but the good thing is other than that there's a lot of nice things like in this software it's very well thought out and laid out I think especially with the haptics and the combination of visual and haptic touches throughout it like pulling up and down the brightness slider you get this nice haptic feed feedback or going up and down in volume it's the same thing it very well thought out in that way so I think if OnePlus really wants to sort of redeem themselves and they look back a little bit at what was so successful with oxygen OS I know they eventually did this merge thing with Oppo and color OS but look at what people loved about oxygen OS and really think about bringing some of those things back okay so this one's competition at 6.99 it's kind of interesting I think today you'd probably consider buying a pixel 7 for 5.99 but what this phone will have over some of these other phones in this price range is some of the highest end specs the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and the 1440p display specifically it'll always have some of those spec things if you're interested in that there's even a 799 version that has 16 gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of storage too so yeah that's that's what feels like sort of classic Redemption OnePlus is this a full Redemption no I'm not going to give them full Redemption status yet uh but if the if the character Arc of OnePlus was kind of like this and then like like this it does feel like this is a inflection point it feels like this is a little bit of a shift in the right direction at least so now I just hope they keep it going you know if they might be past their Peak but their performance and price of this phone show potential thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music]
